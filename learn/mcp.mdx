<Info>
MCP is a protocol that standardizes how an agent discovers tools, requests capabilities, and exchanges structured data with external systems.
</Info>

### Key concepts
- **Host**: runs the LLM/agent
- **Server**: exposes a catalog of tools with schemas and permissions
- **Client**: connects the agent to the server
- **Tools**: typed functions the agent can call (e.g., search, file IO, API)

### Why MCP
- Unified discovery of available tools
- Strong typing and metadata for safer calls
- Isolation and permission prompts for sensitive actions

### Example capability descriptor

```json
{
  "tool": "search",
  "description": "Query indexed docs",
  "inputSchema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "q": { "type": "string" } }, "required": ["q"] },
  "rateLimit": { "rpm": 60 }
}
```
