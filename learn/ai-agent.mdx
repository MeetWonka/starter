### Definition
An AI agent is a software system that can pursue a goal autonomously by planning steps, calling tools or APIs, observing results, and iterating until the objective is reached.

- **Reasoning**: choose next actions based on goals and observations
- **Tools**: call external capabilities (APIs, databases, browsers)
- **Memory**: recall prior steps and domain knowledge
- **Planning**: decompose objectives into actionable tasks

### Minimal agent loop

  A[Goal / Task] --> B[Plan]
  B --> C[Choose Tool]
  C --> D[Execute]
  D --> E[Observe]
  E -->|done?| F{Success?}
  F -- no --> B
  F -- yes --> G[Return result]
```

### Real-world patterns
- Customer support triage and reply drafting
- Data extraction and report generation
- Operations automations (tickets, CRM updates)

<Tip>
Agents are most effective when constrained with clear goals, curated tools, and guardrails.
