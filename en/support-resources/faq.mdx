## Getting started

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is WonkaChat?" icon="circle-question">
WonkaChat is an enterprise AI assistant that connects to your business tools and data to execute multi-step workflows through natural conversation, while keeping your data within your security perimeter. See [What is WonkaChat?](/welcome/introduction).

<Check>
Think of it as one interface that orchestrates actions across your apps (email, calendar, CRM, docs, ERP, and more).
</Check>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get started in 5 minutes?" icon="rocket">
1. Create your account at [wonka.chat/register](https://wonka.chat/register) or sign in via your organization's SSO

2. Send your first message to verify everything works

3. Connect your first connection (email is a great start) via the Connectors settings

4. Try a simple workflow like "Send an email to my team about tomorrow's meeting"

See [Quick Start Guide](/welcome/quick-start).

<Tip>
Start with your email provider (Outlook Mail or Gmail). It unlocks high-value daily workflows.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to code to use WonkaChat?" icon="seedling">
No. You interact through conversation. Advanced users can configure agents and connections without writing code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What can WonkaChat help me accomplish?" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
Common examples include onboarding workflows, intelligent search across softwares, automated reporting, meeting scheduling, and customer support triage. Explore examples in [Welcome → Introduction](/welcome/introduction).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I switch AI models?" icon="sliders">
Yes. Choose pro models for complex reasoning or fast models for quick tasks. You can switch per task or conversation. See [Why Choose WonkaChat?](/welcome/why-wonka-chat).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Models and usage

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Which AI models are supported?" icon="microchip">
WonkaChat is model-agnostic. You can use providers like OpenAI (GPT-5.2, GPT-5, GPT-4o), Anthropic Claude (Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5), Google Gemini (2.5 Pro, 3 Flash), and Mistral. Choose per task based on complexity, speed, and cost. See [Why Choose WonkaChat?](/welcome/why-wonka-chat).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I use a pro model vs a fast model?" icon="brain">
- **Pro models**: Deep analysis, multi-step planning, complex workflows, external connections
- **Fast models**: Quick answers, formatting, short lookups, high-volume operations

Details and examples in [Why Choose WonkaChat?](/welcome/why-wonka-chat) and [Creating Your First Agent](/ai-agents/creating-your-first-agent).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do context windows affect conversations?" icon="memory">
Models only “remember” what fits in the current context window. Very long threads may push earlier details out of scope. If responses degrade, start a new conversation with a short summary. See [Conversation Management](/improved-usage/conversation-management).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I ask better questions?" icon="question">
Be specific, set scope and audience, provide context, and request structured outputs. See patterns and templates in [Asking Great Questions](/improved-usage/asking-great-questions).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## External connections (MCP)

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is MCP and why does it matter?" icon="plug">
MCP (Model Context Protocol) securely connects AI models to your softwares (email, calendar, CRM, storage, ERP, etc.) so the AI can read data and take actions with your permission. See [Tools & Connection → Understanding MCP](/tools-connection/introduction).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I connect my first external software?" icon="link">
Open the Connectors settings (bottom left) → select a connection → authenticate (OAuth/credentials) → enable the connection for your AI model → test with a simple query. Full walkthrough in [Quick Start Guide](/welcome/quick-start).

<Check>
Start with email (Outlook Mail or Gmail) to unlock daily productivity.
</Check>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What can WonkaChat access and do with connected softwares?" icon="hand">
WonkaChat can only access data you already have permission to view and only when you explicitly ask. Actions depend on each connection's (MCP) capabilities (read, write, search, execute workflows). You control all actions through your natural language requests. See [Tools & Connection](/tools-connection/introduction).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How are my credentials stored?" icon="lock">
WonkaChat stores authentication tokens securely (encrypted at rest), never your plain-text passwords. Tokens are per-user, auto-refreshed when needed, and deleted when you disconnect a tool. See [Security Overview](/security-governance/security-overview).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can't the AI access a file or record I asked for?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
Most common reasons: you don't have access in the underlying tool, you denied permissions during authentication, or the tool isn't connected. Verify you can access it directly in the software, then reconnect and grant the requested permissions. See [Troubleshooting Connections](/tools-connection/troubleshooting-connections).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which external connections are supported?" icon="puzzle-piece">
WonkaChat supports 40+ connections across communication, development, operations, analytics, and more including Outlook, Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion, Google Drive, Salesforce, HubSpot, Asana, and many others. See the complete list in [Tools & Connection](/tools-connection/introduction).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## AI agents

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What are AI Agents and how are they different from regular chat?" icon="robot">
AI Agents have persistent instructions, dedicated tools, and consistent roles across conversations - like specialized team members. Regular chat starts fresh each time. Agents are ideal for recurring tasks with specific requirements. See [AI Agents Introduction](/ai-agents/introduction).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I create or use an AI Agent?" icon="bullseye">
Use AI Agents for recurring workflows, multi-tool processes, or when you need standardized outputs. Create personal agents for your specific workflows, or use organization-wide agents shared by administrators. See [Creating Your First Agent](/ai-agents/creating-your-first-agent).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I find and access agents?" icon="magnifying-glass">
Access agents through the Agent Marketplace or "My Agents" section in your WonkaChat interface. You can search, filter, and select agents based on your needs. See [Finding and Accessing Agents](/ai-agents/finding-and-accessing-agents).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if an agent doesn't have the information or tools it needs?" icon="wrench">
- **As a user**: Provide missing details in your prompt, or choose a different agent with the appropriate tools configured
- **As an administrator**: Update the agent's instructions, add relevant documents, or connect the required external tools

See [Using Existing Agents](/ai-agents/using-existing-agents).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Business Teaching and why should I use it?" icon="graduation-cap">
Business Teaching allows you to add your company's terminology, policies, and processes to AI Agents through custom instructions and uploaded documents. This ensures responses match your organization's specific context rather than generic assumptions. See [Business Teaching](/ai-agents/business-teaching).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security and governance

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Does WonkaChat train AI models on my data?" icon="ban">
No. Your conversations are stored securely in WonkaChat for your history and reference, but model providers process requests ephemerally without data retention or training. Your data never trains AI models. See [Security Overview](/security-governance/security-overview).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is my data isolated and protected?" icon="building-lock">
WonkaChat uses organization-scoped isolation, encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest, secure token storage, and automatic redaction of sensitive data in logs. Your data stays within your security perimeter. See [Security Overview](/security-governance/security-overview).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What authentication methods are supported?" icon="key">
WonkaChat supports Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and email/password authentication. Enterprise plans can configure custom SSO providers. Access tokens and refresh tokens balance security with usability. See [Security Overview](/security-governance/security-overview).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does access control and sharing work?" icon="user-shield">
WonkaChat has two roles: **User** and **Administrator**. Administrators manage users, share AI Agents organization-wide, and control tool access. Users can create personal agents but cannot share them across the organization. See [Access Control](/security-governance/access-control).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can AI Agents escalate privileges or bypass permissions?" icon="shield-halved">
No. AI Agents inherit your exact permissions from connected softwares. If you can't perform an action manually, agents can't either. Tool restriction features let you remove specific capabilities from agents for additional safety. See [Access Control](/security-governance/access-control).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Safe Mode and when should I use it?" icon="shield-check">
Safe Mode requires your approval before AI Agents execute actions. Use it for sensitive operations like sending communications, modifying production data, deployments, and financial transactions. See [Access Control](/security-governance/access-control).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I'm seeing authentication errors when connecting a tool" icon="circle-xmark">
Verify your credentials by logging into the tool directly first. Then disconnect and reconnect through WonkaChat's Connectors settings, ensuring you grant all requested permissions during authentication. See [Troubleshooting Connections](/tools-connection/troubleshooting-connections).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I get 'permission denied' when accessing data" icon="ban">
Common causes: your organization blocks third-party apps, you didn't grant all required permissions during setup, or your account lacks access to that data. Contact your IT team to approve WonkaChat, then reconnect with full permissions. See [Troubleshooting Connections](/tools-connection/troubleshooting-connections).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Responses are slow or timing out" icon="clock">
Try these steps: refresh WonkaChat, check your internet connection, reduce query scope (use date ranges or filters), switch to a faster model, or verify the connected software's status. See [Troubleshooting Connections](/tools-connection/troubleshooting-connections).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AI Agent responses don't match my expectations" icon="pen-to-square">
Be more specific about desired format and scope in your prompt. Review the agent's instructions to ensure alignment. Administrators can refine agent instructions, add business context, or connect additional tools. See [Using Existing Agents](/ai-agents/using-existing-agents) and [Asking Great Questions](/improved-usage/asking-great-questions).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I get help?" icon="life-ring">
Visit [Getting Help](/support-resources/getting-help) for support options, contact our team at [meetwonka.com/contact](https://www.meetwonka.com/fr/contact), or explore [Troubleshooting](/support-resources/troubleshooting) for common issues and solutions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Prompting, conversations, and the prompt library

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I write better prompts?" icon="list">
Structure prompts with clear context, specific goals, desired output format, and relevant constraints. Provide examples when helpful and specify your audience. The more specific you are, the better results you'll get. See [Asking Great Questions](/improved-usage/asking-great-questions).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I start a new conversation?" icon="arrows-turn-to-dots">
Start a new conversation when changing topics, after very long threads (context window limits), or when response quality declines. Begin the new conversation with a brief summary of relevant context if needed. See [Conversation Management](/improved-usage/conversation-management).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I save and reuse prompts?" icon="bookmark">
Use the Prompt Library to save effective prompts with variables like `{{current_date}}` or `{{current_user}}`. Create reusable templates for common tasks and invoke them quickly with slash commands. See [Prompt Library](/improved-usage/prompt-library).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Policies and risk management

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What practices reduce risk when using AI?" icon="clipboard-check">
- Enable Safe Mode for high-impact actions
- Test workflows in non-production environments first
- Use least-privilege access (only grant necessary permissions)
- Break complex workflows into reviewable steps
- Remove destructive capabilities from AI Agents when not needed

See [Best Practices](/security-governance/best-practices).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I undo actions performed by AI?" icon="rotate-left">
Many tool actions are irreversible (sending emails, deleting data, deployments, financial transactions). Always use Safe Mode for sensitive operations, restrict destructive capabilities, and review outputs before final execution. See [Best Practices](/security-governance/best-practices).
</Accordion>
