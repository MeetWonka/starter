### Sharing Agents

<Info>
**TODO**: Add video tutorials for admin sharing workflow
</Info>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="I'm an Administrator">

As an administrator, you have direct control over agent sharing from the Agent Builder.

#### How to Share an Agent

In the Agent Builder panel, you'll find sharing options that allow you to control agent visibility and permissions:

<Frame caption="Agent sharing options for administrators">
<video
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
  src="/videos/admin-agent-sharing.mp4"
  title="Admin Agent Sharing Workflow"
>
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</Frame>

**Sharing controls:**

1. **Share to Organization**: Toggle to make the agent available to all users or specific groups
2. **Modification Permissions**: Control who can modify the agent
   - **Admins only**: Only administrators can edit the agent configuration
   - **All users**: Any user in the organization can modify the agent

<Check>
Use modification permissions wisely. Allowing all users to edit enables collaborative agent development but may reduce consistency.
</Check>

<Warning>
Sharing an agent makes it visible based on your permission settings. Review agent instructions and tool access before sharing to ensure they meet security standards.
</Warning>

</Tab>

<Tab title="I'm a User">

As a standard user, you can create personal agents but need administrator approval to share them organization-wide.

#### How to Request Agent Sharing

1. Create and test your agent thoroughly
2. Contact your administrator to request sharing
3. Administrator reviews configuration and security
4. Once approved, agent becomes available to designated users or groups

<Tip>
When requesting agent sharing, explain the use case and benefits to help administrators understand why the agent should be available organization-wide.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Only administrators can share agents organization-wide. This maintains security and governance standards.
</Warning>
