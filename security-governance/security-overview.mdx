WonkaChat is built with security at its core. From isolated data environments to strict permission boundaries, we ensure your data remains protected while you leverage the power of AI agents.

---

## Security Architecture

WonkaChat employs a multi-layered security architecture designed for enterprise environments.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="SOC2-Certified Security">
WonkaChat maintains SOC2 Type II certification, ensuring enterprise-grade security controls across all operations. Our security practices undergo regular third-party audits to verify compliance with industry standards.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Isolated Data Environment">
Your data stays in a fully isolated, secure environment — either self-hosted or hosted by WonkaChat with data remaining clustered and separated from other organizations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Secure Model Access">
All AI models interact via Azure and AWS Bedrock APIs, ensuring your data is never stored or reused by model providers. Your information remains ephemeral during processing.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Safe Mode: Control AI Actions

Safe Mode ensures you maintain complete control over what AI agents can do in your environment.


<img src="/images/safe-mode.png" alt="Safe Mode interface showing action approval" />


### How Safe Mode Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Action Request">
When an AI agent wants to execute an action, it must request your approval before proceeding.
</Step>

<Step title="Review & Decision">
You can review the specific action details and decide whether to allow or deny the request.
</Step>

<Step title="Execution or Block">
Actions only execute after your explicit approval. You can deactivate Safe Mode for trusted agents if desired.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**AI agents execute actions and use tools only when you allow it.** You decide if actions can be done with the clear option to pause or let AI act freely by deactivating Safe Mode.
</Warning>

## MCP Usage Privileges

WonkaChat respects and enforces existing permission boundaries in your connected tools.

### No Extra Privileges

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Strict Permission Boundaries" icon="shield-halved">
When connected to work applications through MCP, users **never receive more permissions** or access rights than they already have within that application.
</Card>

<Card title="No Permission Escalation" icon="lock">
AI agents cannot override, bypass, or escalate user permissions in connected tools. If you can't access something manually, the AI can't access it either.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Check>
Your existing security policies and access controls remain fully intact when using WonkaChat with MCP connections.
</Check>

### MCP Connection Security

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Permission Inheritance">
AI agents inherit your current user permissions when accessing connected tools. They operate within the same constraints as manual access.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Access Boundaries">
Tool connections respect your organization's existing access control lists, security groups, and permission schemes without modification.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Audit Trail">
All MCP operations are logged and traceable, maintaining visibility into AI agent actions across connected tools.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Data Privacy

WonkaChat maintains strict data privacy standards to protect your sensitive information.

### Privacy Guarantees

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Data Isolation" icon="database">
Your data stays in a fully isolated, secure environment. Whether self-hosted or WonkaChat-hosted, your data remains clustered and separated from other organizations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Model Training" icon="brain">
Your data is never used to train AI models. All interactions with AI models via Azure and AWS Bedrock APIs are ephemeral and not stored.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Encrypted Communications" icon="lock">
All data in transit is encrypted using industry-standard TLS protocols. Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data Residency" icon="globe">
You control where your data is hosted, with options for regional data centers or self-hosted deployments to meet compliance requirements.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy Considerations

### What to Know About Your Data

<Info>
WonkaChat processes conversation context to provide AI assistance. While we maintain strict security measures, you should follow your organization's policies regarding sensitive information.
</Info>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Conversation Context" icon="comments">
AI agents have access to conversation history within their assigned scope to provide contextual assistance.
</Card>

<Card title="Tool Access" icon="wrench">
Connected tools provide data to AI agents based on your existing permissions — the same data you could manually access.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
For highly sensitive operations, use Safe Mode to review all AI actions before execution, ensuring you maintain oversight of data access.
