Use WonkaChat safely and effectively by following these best practices. Learn how to manage AI scope, handle sensitive information, and minimize risks in your organization.

<Tip>
These guidelines help you leverage AI capabilities while maintaining security, privacy, and control over your data and systems.
</Tip>

---

## Acceptable Use Guidelines

Follow these principles to ensure safe and responsible AI usage in your organization.

### Scope AI Tasks Appropriately

<Warning>
**Avoid massive refactors or broad changes.** AI agents work best with clearly defined, limited-scope tasks. Large-scale changes increase error risk and reduce oversight.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Define Clear Boundaries">
Give AI agents specific, well-defined tasks rather than open-ended instructions. For example, "refactor the authentication module" is better than "improve the entire codebase."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Break Down Complex Tasks">
Split large projects into smaller, manageable subtasks. Review and approve each subtask completion before proceeding to the next.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Safe Mode for Critical Operations">
Enable Safe Mode when working on production systems, sensitive data, or mission-critical components to review every action before execution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Maintain Human Oversight">
AI agents augment human work — they don't replace human judgment. Always review AI outputs, especially for important decisions or changes.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Sensitive Information Handling

Protect confidential and sensitive data when working with AI agents.

### What to Avoid Sharing

<Warning>
Never share credentials, API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens in AI conversations, even temporarily. Use environment variables or secure vaults instead.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify Sensitive Data">
Recognize what constitutes sensitive information in your organization:
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- Financial data and payment information
- Authentication credentials and API keys
- Proprietary business information
- Healthcare or legal records
</Step>

<Step title="Use Data Masking">
Replace sensitive values with placeholders when discussing code or configurations with AI agents.

```javascript
// ❌ Don't share actual credentials
const apiKey = "sk_live_abc123xyz789";

// ✅ Use placeholders instead
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```
</Step>

<Step title="Review Before Sharing Context">
Before granting an AI agent access to files or systems, verify they don't contain sensitive information that shouldn't be processed.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Safe Data Practices

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Use Test Data">
When demonstrating issues or requesting AI assistance, use anonymized test data or synthetic examples rather than production data.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Limit Context Scope">
Provide AI agents with only the specific files, directories, or data they need to complete a task. Avoid granting broad access to entire systems.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Configure MCP Carefully">
When connecting tools via MCP, audit what data the AI can access and ensure it aligns with your security policies.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
Remember: AI agents inherit your permissions. If you can access sensitive data, the AI can too when connected to those systems.
</Info>

## Risk Management

Minimize risks when deploying AI agents in your organization.

### Permission Management

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Principle of Least Privilege" icon="shield-halved">
Grant AI agents and users only the minimum permissions needed to complete their tasks. Avoid blanket "admin" access.
</Card>

<Card title="Regular Permission Audits" icon="clipboard-check">
Review and update permissions regularly as roles and responsibilities change within your organization.
</Card>

<Card title="Time-Limited Access" icon="clock">
Consider temporary permission grants for specific projects, revoking access when the work is complete.
</Card>

<Card title="Monitor Usage Patterns" icon="chart-line">
Track how AI agents and users access tools to identify unusual patterns that might indicate security issues.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Change Management

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Version Control Everything">
Always use version control (e.g., Git) when AI agents make code changes. This provides rollback capability and change tracking.

<Check>
Commit frequently and use descriptive commit messages to understand what the AI changed and why.
</Check>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Before Production">
Never allow AI agents to make changes directly to production systems. Use development and staging environments first.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Implement Approval Workflows">
Require human approval for critical changes, deployments, or operations that affect production systems or sensitive data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Maintain Rollback Plans">
Ensure you can quickly revert AI-generated changes if issues arise. Keep backups and document recovery procedures.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Training and Awareness

Educate your team on safe AI usage to create a security-conscious culture.

### User Education

<Steps>
<Step title="Onboarding Training">
Provide comprehensive training when users first access WonkaChat, covering security features, best practices, and organizational policies.
</Step>

<Step title="Regular Updates">
Share updates about new features, security enhancements, and evolving best practices as AI technology changes.
</Step>

<Step title="Incident Reporting">
Establish clear procedures for users to report security concerns, unexpected AI behavior, or potential data exposure.
</Step>

<Step title="Continuous Learning">
Encourage users to share learnings and experiences to build organizational knowledge about effective and safe AI usage.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Create internal documentation specific to your organization's AI policies, including approved use cases and examples from your domain.
</Tip>
