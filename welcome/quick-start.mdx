## Your 5-Minute Success Path

<Steps>
<Step title="First Login and Account Access">

Access WonkaChat through one of two methods:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Team SSO Login">
If your organization has already set up WonkaChat, use your existing work credentials:

**Sign in with:**
- **Google Workspace** (your company Google account)
- **Microsoft 365** (your company Microsoft account)
- **Other SSO providers** your organization has configured

<Info>
SSO uses OpenID Connect for secure, seamless authentication with your existing credentials.
</Info>

<Check>
No new password to remember—just use your existing work account credentials.
</Check>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Invitation Setup">
If you're the first user from your organization:

1. Check your email for a WonkaChat invitation
2. Click the invitation link
3. Create your account credentials
4. Complete your profile setup
5. Begin configuring your organization's WonkaChat instance

<Tip>
After initial setup, you can enable SSO for your team so everyone can use their existing work credentials.
</Tip>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**What you'll see after login:**
- Clean chat interface in the center
- Connected tools and agents in the sidebar
- Model selection options in the settings
- Your prompt library and saved conversations

</Step>

<Step title="Quick Navigation Tour">

<Info>
**Video Tutorial Coming Soon**

We're preparing a comprehensive video walkthrough of the WonkaChat interface. This space will contain an interactive tutorial showing you how to navigate the platform, access key features, and customize your workspace.
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Test Your First Message">

Let's make sure everything works with a simple test:

### Send a Basic Message

Type something simple in the chat:

```
Hello! Can you introduce yourself?
```

WonkaChat will respond, confirming the platform is working correctly.

<Check>
If you receive a response, you're all set! The AI is connected and ready to help.
</Check>


</Step>

<Step title="Connect Your First Tool (Outlook)">

Now let's connect WonkaChat to your email account so it can access your emails and calendar.

<Warning>
This example uses **Outlook**, but the process is identical for **Gmail**, or any other email system. Simply click the corresponding MCP button for your email provider and follow the same steps.
</Warning>

### Step-by-Step Connection

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the MCP Settings">
On the right side of your WonkaChat interface, locate and click the **Outlook MCP** button in the tools panel.

</Frame>

<Info>
**What is MCP?** MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the technology that connects AI models to your tools and software, allowing WonkaChat to interact with your business systems. 
For a deeper understanding of MCP and advanced connection options, visit the [Tools & Connection](/tools-connection/introduction) section.
</Info>

</Step>


<Step title="Add Your Credentials">
A connection window will appear asking for your credentials. Enter the required information:
- Your Outlook email address
- Authentication credentials (this will use your organization's authentication method)

<Frame caption="Outlook MCP credentials screen">
<img src="/images/outlook-mcp-credentials.png" alt="Outlook MCP credential input screen" />
</Frame>

<Info>
WonkaChat uses secure authentication and never stores your password. All credentials are encrypted.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Enable MCP for Your Model">
After connecting, you need to authorize the MCP connection for the AI model you're using.

<Frame caption="Enable MCP for your model">
<img src="/images/enable-mcp-model.png" alt="Enable MCP connection for the AI model" />
</Frame>

Click **"MCP Servers"** and select which MCP you want the AI model to use.

<Check>
Once the Outlook MCP is enabled, the AI can read your emails, access your calendar, send messages on your behalf, and handle any Outlook-related tasks through natural conversation.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

</Step>

<Step title="Your First Connected Conversation">

Now that Outlook is connected, let's use it in a conversation:

### Send a message to the connected AI model

Type something like:

```
What's on my outlook calendar today?
```
<Warning>
The AI will only access Outlook data when you explicitly ask it to. It respects your existing permissions and won't perform actions without your knowledge.
</Warning>


WonkaChat will:
- Access your Outlook calendar through the MCP connection
- Retrieve your schedule
- Present it in an organized format

<Check>
You've successfully connected a tool and used it through natural conversation!
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Understanding Model Selection">

Choose the right model for your task:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Thinking Models" icon="brain">
**Use for complex tasks:**
- Strategic analysis
- Multi-step problem solving
- Data analysis and insights
- Complex workflow planning

**Example:** "Analyze our Q3 sales data and recommend improvements"
</Card>

<Card title="Fast/Non-Thinking Models" icon="bolt">
**Use for quick tasks:**
- Simple questions
- Fast information retrieval
- Basic formatting
- Quick summaries

**Example:** "What's my next meeting?"
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
When in doubt, start with thinking models for important tasks. You can always switch to fast/non-thinking models for speed and cost once you understand the query complexity.
</Tip>
