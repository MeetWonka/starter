## Your 5-Minute Success Path

<Steps>
<Step title="First Login and Account Access">

Access WonkaChat through one of two methods:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Team SSO Login">
If your organization has already set up WonkaChat, use your existing work credentials:

**Sign in with:**
- **Google Workspace** (your company Google account)
- **Microsoft 365** (your company Microsoft account)
- **Other SSO providers** your organization has configured

<Info>
SSO uses OpenID Connect for secure, seamless authentication with your existing credentials.
</Info>

<Check>
No new password to remember—just use your existing work account credentials.
</Check>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Invitation Setup">
If you're the first user from your organization:

1. Check your email for a WonkaChat invitation
2. Click the invitation link
3. Create your account credentials
4. Complete your profile setup
5. Begin configuring your organization's WonkaChat instance

<Tip>
After initial setup, you can enable SSO for your team so everyone can use their existing work credentials.
</Tip>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**What you'll see after login:**
- Clean chat interface in the center
- Connected tools and agents in the sidebar
- Model selection options in the settings
- Your prompt library and saved conversations

</Step>

<Step title="Quick Navigation Tour">

<Info>
**Video Tutorial Coming Soon**

We're preparing a comprehensive video walkthrough of the WonkaChat interface. This space will contain an interactive tutorial showing you how to navigate the platform, access key features, and customize your workspace.
</Info>

### Interface Overview (Text Guide)

While the video tutorial is being finalized, here's a quick overview:

**Main Chat Interface:**
- Type your queries and requests in natural language
- View AI responses and workflow progress in real-time
- See which tools are being accessed during execution

**Sidebar Navigation:**
- **AI Agents**: Access pre-built and custom agents
- **Prompt Library**: Your saved prompts and templates
- **Connected Tools**: View and manage tool integrations
- **Conversations**: Browse conversation history

**Top Bar:**
- **Model Selector**: Switch between thinking and non-thinking models
- **Settings**: Configure preferences and connections
- **Profile**: Manage your account and organization settings

<Tip>
Bookmark conversations you want to reference later using the bookmark icon.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Your First Conversation">

Start with a simple query to experience WonkaChat's capabilities:

### Try This First

Type something like:

```
What's on my calendar today?
```

WonkaChat will:
- Connect to your calendar system
- Retrieve your schedule
- Present it in an organized format

### Example: Multi-Tool Workflow

Once comfortable, try something more powerful. Here's a real example:

<Frame caption="Example: Automated employee onboarding across multiple systems">
<img src="/images/wonkachat-intro.png" alt="Onboarding Agent orchestrating tasks across Notion, Outlook, Odoo, and other business tools" />
</Frame>

In this example, a request to "Run New Employee Onboarding" automatically:

1. ✅ Gets information from **Notion** (onboarding checklist)
2. ✅ Creates email account in **Microsoft 365**
3. ✅ Sends access codes via **Outlook**
4. ✅ Schedules onboarding meeting in **Outlook Calendar**
5. ✅ Creates **Odoo** account and sends invitation
6. ✅ Sends onboarding presentation via email

**Connected tools shown:** Google Drive, Outlook, Odoo, Azure, SharePoint, and more—all orchestrated through one simple conversation.

<Check>
This is the power of WonkaChat: complex multi-step workflows across different tools, managed through natural conversation.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Understanding Model Selection">

Choose the right model for your task:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Thinking Models" icon="brain">
**Use for complex tasks:**
- Strategic analysis
- Multi-step problem solving
- Data analysis and insights
- Complex workflow planning

**Example:** "Analyze our Q3 sales data and recommend improvements"
</Card>

<Card title="Non-Thinking Models" icon="bolt">
**Use for quick tasks:**
- Simple questions
- Fast information retrieval
- Basic formatting
- Quick summaries

**Example:** "What's my next meeting?"
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
When in doubt, start with thinking models for important tasks. You can always switch to non-thinking models for speed once you understand the query complexity.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Exploring Connected Tools">

WonkaChat's true power comes from connecting your business tools.

```

**Component Details:**

- **Web UI**: React-based interface, served via Nginx
- **API Gateway**: GraphQL/REST endpoints, request routing
- **Auth Service**: SSO integration, session management, RBAC
- **Agent Execution**: Workflow orchestration, tool calling
- **Tool Connection**: MCP protocol handlers, API integrations
- **Model Inference**: AI provider abstraction, request handling

---

## Tool Connection Architecture

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

WonkaChat uses MCP for secure, standardized tool connections:

**MCP Connection Flow:**
```
User Request → Agent Analysis → Tool Selection → 
MCP Protocol → External API → Response Processing → 
Context Integration → AI Response
```

**Key Components:**

1. **MCP Server**: Handles tool registration and discovery
2. **Connection Pool**: Manages persistent connections to external APIs
3. **Auth Manager**: Secures credentials and tokens per integration
4. **Response Cache**: Caches appropriate responses for performance
5. **Rate Limiter**: Enforces API rate limits per provider

<Tip>
MCP architecture details and custom tool development are covered in [Tools & Connection](/tools-connection/introduction).

## Model Selection and Routing

### Technical Implementation

**Model Types:**

```javascript
// Thinking Models (Complex Reasoning)
models: {
  thinking: [
    'gpt-4-turbo',
    'gpt-4',
    'claude-3-opus',
    'claude-3-sonnet',
    'gemini-ultra'
  ],
  
  // Non-Thinking Models (Fast Response)
  nonThinking: [
    'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    'claude-3-haiku',
    'gemini-pro'
  ]
}
```

**Automatic Model Routing Logic:**

WonkaChat can analyze queries and route to appropriate models:

```python
def select_model(query, context):
    complexity_score = analyze_complexity(query)
    requires_reasoning = check_reasoning_needed(query)
    context_size = calculate_context_tokens(context)
    
    if complexity_score > THRESHOLD or requires_reasoning:
        return select_thinking_model(context_size)
    else:
        return select_fast_model(context_size)
```

**Factors Considered:**
- Query complexity (keywords, structure)
- Required reasoning depth
- Context window size needed
- Historical performance for similar queries
- Organization's model preferences
- Cost optimization settings
