### Send a Basic Message

Type something simple in the chat:

Can you say "Hello World" please?

</Step>


<Step title="Add Your Credentials">
A connection window will appear asking for your credentials. Enter the required information:
- Your Outlook email address
- Authentication credentials (this will use your organization's authentication method)

<Info>
WonkaChat uses secure authentication and never stores your password. All credentials are encrypted.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Connection for Your Model">
After connecting, you need to authorize the external connection for the AI model you're using.

</Frame>

Click **"Connectors"** and select which connection you want the AI model to use.

<Check>
Once the Outlook Mail connection is enabled, the AI can read your emails, access your calendar, send messages on your behalf, and handle any Outlook-related tasks through natural conversation.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

</Step>

<Step title="Your First Connected Conversation">

Now that Outlook Mail is connected, let's use it in a conversation:

### Send a message to the connected AI model

Type something like:

```
Send an email to Sarah letting her know I'll be 5 minutes late to the meeting.
```
<Warning>
The AI will only interact with Outlook or send messages when you explicitly request it. It always follows your permissions and never takes action without your direction.
</Warning>

WonkaChat will:
- Access your Outlook account through the configured connection
- Draft an email to Sarah with your update
- Send directly the mail or present it for review before sending (depends on your prompt and on the model used)

<Check>
You've successfully connected a tool and used it through natural conversation!
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Understanding Model Selection">
