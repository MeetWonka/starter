Wonka Chat is an enterprise AI assistant that connects directly to your business tools, software, and data to help you accomplish complex tasks through simple conversation while maintaining your privacy and data integrity.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Getting Started">

## Core Concept

Wonka Chat consolidates your work across multiple software applications into a single chat interface. Instead of switching between different tools, you interact with one interface that coordinates actions across your connected systems.

Think of it as your intelligent business assistant that:
- Understands your company's processes and data
- Connects to all your existing tools and systems
- Executes multi-step workflows across different platforms
- Keeps your data secure within your environment

<Frame caption="Example: Automated employee onboarding across multiple systems">
<img src="/images/wonkachat-intro.png" alt="Onboarding Agent orchestrating tasks across Notion, Outlook, Odoo, and other business tools" />
</Frame>

In this example, a request to "Run New Employee Onboarding" automatically:

1. ✅ Gets information from **Notion** (onboarding checklist)
2. ✅ Creates email account in **Microsoft 365**
3. ✅ Sends access codes via **Outlook**
4. ✅ Schedules onboarding meeting in **Outlook Calendar**
5. ✅ Creates **Odoo** account and sends invitation
6. ✅ Sends onboarding presentation via email

<Check>
This is the power of WonkaChat: complex multi-step workflows across different tools, managed through natural conversation.
</Check>

In this example, a simple request triggers actions across Notion, Outlook, Odoo, and other tools, all coordinated through one platform and one conversation.

## AI Model Infrastructure

### Model Selection Architecture

WonkaChat is **model-agnostic**. We are not an AI provider, but rather a platform that integrates with your chosen AI models.

**Supported model types:**
- **Thinking models**: For complex reasoning tasks requiring multi-step analysis
- **Fast/Non-thinking models**: For rapid responses to straightforward queries
- **Custom models**: Integrate your own fine-tuned or proprietary models

### Provider Flexibility

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Bring Your Own Model" icon="box">
Connect to any AI provider including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or self-hosted models.
</Card>

<Card title="Cost-Performance Optimization" icon="gauge-high">
Choose models based on your specific trade-offs between response quality, speed, and cost.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security Architecture

- **Data isolation**: Each tenant's data is isolated in separate namespaces
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Access control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- **Audit logging**: Complete audit trail of all actions and data access

For comprehensive security documentation, see [Security & Governance](/security-governance/security-overview).
