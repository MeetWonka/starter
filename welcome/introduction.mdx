WonkaChat is an enterprise AI assistant that connects directly to your business tools, software, and data to help you accomplish complex tasks through simple conversation while maintaining your privacy and data integrity.


## Core Concept

Wonka Chat consolidates your work across multiple software applications into a single chat interface. Instead of switching between different tools and softwares, you interact with one interface that coordinates actions across your connected systems.

Think of it as your intelligent business assistant that:
- Understands your company's processes and data
- Connects to all your existing softwares and tools
- Executes multi-step workflows across different platforms
- Keeps your data secure within your environment

</Frame>

In this example, a request to "Run New Employee Onboarding" automatically:

1. ✅ Gets information from **Notion** (onboarding checklist)
2. ✅ Creates email account in **Microsoft 365**
3. ✅ Sends access codes via **Outlook**
4. ✅ Schedules onboarding meeting in **Outlook Calendar**
5. ✅ Creates **Odoo** account and sends invitation
6. ✅ Sends onboarding presentation via email

This is the power of WonkaChat: complex multi-step workflows across different softwares, managed through natural conversation.

In this example, a simple request triggers actions across Notion, Outlook, Odoo, and other tools, all coordinated through one platform and one conversation.
