## Security and Governance Advantages

**Public AI platforms** like ChatGPT store your data on their servers, may use it for training, and give you limited control over security and access.

**WonkaChat operates on a different foundation:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Built-In Security" icon="shield-check">
You receive a completely isolated environment with encrypted communications and a security architecture that undergoes independent audits.
</Card>

<Card title="No Data Collection" icon="ban">
Your conversations are never collected, stored by AI providers, or used to train models. Everything stays private.
</Card>

<Card title="AI Training" icon="certificate">
We offer comprehensive training to our clients on how to use AI securely, ensuring best practices are followed to protect your data and maintain compliance.
</Card>

<Card title="Access & Control" icon="users-gear">
Role-based permissions, features to approve actions, and granular control over who can use which features and agents.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
WonkaChat provides both robust security infrastructure **and** the governance tools you need to stay compliant and maintain control.

**Key MCP Capabilities:**
- Direct integration with business systems (Outlook, Gmail, Salesforce, Notion, etc.)
- Secure credential management and authentication
- Real-time data access and write operations
- Permission inheritance from your existing user access
