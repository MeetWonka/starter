Understanding how AI models handle conversation history is essential for getting consistent, relevant responses. This guide explains context windows and strategies for managing conversations effectively.

<Info>
AI models don't have memory across separate conversations, they only remember what's in the current conversation's context window.

## What is a Context Window?

Think of the context window as the AI's "working memory", it's how much of your conversation the AI can "see" and remember at any given moment.

**Analogy:**
Imagine reading a book through a narrow slot that only shows you a few pages at a time. As you slide the slot forward to read new pages, the earlier pages slide out of view. That's how a context window works.

### Why It Matters

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Response Relevance" icon="bullseye">
The AI can only reference information within its current context window.
</Card>

<Card title="Coherence" icon="link">
Details from early in very long conversations may be "forgotten" as they fall outside the window.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### What Happens When Context Fills Up?

When a conversation exceeds the context window, the AI "forgets" the earliest parts of your conversation. This can lead to:

- Loss of context from earlier decisions or information
- Potential inconsistency with earlier statements
- Confused responses when you reference old messages

<Warning>
If you reference something from much earlier in a long conversation and get a confused response, the context window may be full. Start a new conversation and summarize the relevant context.
</Warning>

## When to Start or Continue a Conversation

Use the following guidance to decide whether to start a new conversation or continue your current one for optimal AI responses.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Start a New Conversation" icon="sparkles">

You should start a new conversation when:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Changing Topics" icon="arrows-turn-to-dots">
You are moving to a completely unrelated subject.
</Card>

<Card title="AI Gets Confused" icon="circle-question">
The AI seems confused or gives inaccurate, off-topic, or incorrect responses.
</Card>

<Card title="Long Exchanges" icon="scroll">
Your conversation has become lengthy with extended back-and-forth.
</Card>

<Card title="Need a Fresh Perspective" icon="broom-ball">
You want an unbiased answer, free from prior discussion context.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
If response quality drops or the AI references outdated information, it is often more efficient to start a new conversation with a concise summary of your current needs rather than trying to correct the ongoing one.
</Warning>

</Tab>


<Tab title="Continue the Current Conversation" icon="layer-group">

Continue the current conversation when:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Building on Previous Work" icon="layer-group">
Each exchange builds directly on earlier questions or results.
</Card>

<Card title="Iterative Refinement" icon="pen-to-square">
You are improving, refining, or revising what was previously discussed.
</Card>

<Card title="Exploring Related Subtopics" icon="sitemap">
You are delving into related facets or aspects of the same overall topic.
</Card>

<Card title="Maintaining Context" icon="memory">
The AI needs to remember prior details, choices, or constraints to respond effectively.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Ask yourself: “Does the AI need to retain our earlier discussion to answer this well?” If yes, continue. If not, start a new conversation.
</Tip>

## Building on Previous Responses

Effective conversation flow builds naturally on what's already been discussed.

**Example progression:**
```
You: "Explain the benefits of containerization with Docker."

AI: [Provides explanation including portability, consistency, and isolation]

You: "You mentioned isolation as a benefit. How does Docker's isolation 
compare to traditional virtual machines in terms of resource usage?"
```

In longer conversations, periodically summarize key points to reinforce important context:

```
So far we've established that:
1. Microservices offer scalability benefits for our use case
2. The team needs Kubernetes experience
3. The initial setup cost is approximately 3 months

Given this context, what's the recommended team structure?
```

### Understanding Tokens and Model Selection

Context windows are measured in **tokens** that represent roughly 4 characters or about ¾ of a word.

**Common Models and Their Context Windows:**

| Model | Context Window | Best For |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **GPT-4o** | 128K tokens | Balanced performance, general-purpose tasks |
| **GPT-4o mini** | 128K tokens | High-volume, cost-sensitive conversations |
| **Claude Sonnet 4** | 200K tokens | Advanced reasoning, document analysis |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | 1M tokens | Extended conversations, large document analysis |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | 1M tokens | Speed-optimized long conversations |

### Managing Multiple Workstreams

For juggling multiple projects, use separate conversations by project:

```
Conversation 1: "Project Alpha - Frontend Development"
Conversation 2: "Project Alpha - Backend API"
Conversation 3: "Project Beta - Data Analysis"
```

This approach keeps context clean and prevents "polluting" your context window with information that might bias future responses.

### Rehydrating Context

When starting a fresh conversation about a related topic, provide a concise summary of relevant prior context:

```
"Context from previous session: We're implementing a new CRM system for 
our sales team of 50 people. Budget is $100K, timeline is 6 months, and 
we need integration with our existing email platform and calendar system.

New question: Given these requirements, what training approach would you 
recommend for onboarding the sales team?"
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Expecting the AI to Remember Past Conversations">
**Problem:** Starting a new conversation with "As we discussed yesterday..." without re-establishing context.

**Solution:** Always provide relevant context at the start of new conversations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Overloading a Single Conversation">
**Problem:** Using one conversation for multiple unrelated tasks, leading to confused responses.

**Solution:** Start new conversations for distinct topics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ignoring Quality Decline">
**Problem:** Continuing a conversation even when responses become less relevant or accurate.

**Solution:** Recognize when the context window is full and start fresh with a summary.
