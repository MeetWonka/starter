Getting high-quality responses from AI models starts with well-crafted questions. This guide progresses from basic principles to advanced techniques, helping you continuously improve your prompting skills.

<Info>
The quality of AI responses directly correlates with the clarity and structure of your prompts. Small improvements in how you ask questions can dramatically improve results.
</Info>

## Basic Prompting Principles

The foundation of effective AI interaction:

- **Be clear and specific** ‚Äì Vague questions produce vague answers
- **Use positive instructions** ‚Äì Focus on what you want, not what you don't want  
- **Provide context** ‚Äì Give relevant background information to tailor responses

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Be clear and specific" icon="bullseye">
The more specific your request, the better the response.

**Instead of:**
```
Tell me about marketing.
```

**Try:**
```
Explain the three most effective digital marketing strategies for 
a B2B SaaS company with a $10,000 monthly budget.
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use positive instructions" icon="check">
Focus on what you want the AI to do, rather than what you don't want.

**Instead of:**
```
Don't be too technical.
```

**Try:**
```
Explain this in simple terms that a non-technical business owner 
would understand.
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Provide context" icon="circle-info">
Give the AI relevant background information to tailor its response.

**Example:**
```
I'm a product manager at a fintech startup. We're deciding between 
microservices and monolithic architecture for our MVP. What factors 
should we consider given our 3-month launch timeline and team of 
4 developers?
```

<Tip>
Think of the AI as a knowledgeable colleague who needs context to give you the best advice.

## Context Setting Techniques

Proper context ensures the AI understands your goals, audience, and constraints.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Define Your Audience" icon="users">
Specify who will use or read the response to adjust complexity and tone.
</Card>

<Card title="Set the Scope" icon="bullseye">
Clearly define boundaries to prevent overly broad or narrow responses.
</Card>

<Card title="Provide Examples" icon="lightbulb">
Show examples of what you're looking for to guide the output style.
</Card>

<Card title="State Your Goal" icon="flag-checkered">
Explain what you'll do with the response to get more actionable results.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Effective Context-Setting Pattern

Use this structure to provide comprehensive context:

```
[Role/Perspective]: I'm a [your role] working on [project/task]

[Situation]: Currently, [describe your situation]

üéØ [GOAL]: What I need to achieve

üìè [SCOPE - Constraints]: 
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]
- [Constraint 3]

üë• [AUDIENCE]: Who will use/read this or explain the format the output needs to have

üí° [EXAMPLES]: Relevant examples or current approach (if applicable)

[Your specific question]
```

**Example:**
```
Role: I'm a data analyst at a healthcare startup

Situation: We have patient satisfaction survey data from 500 respondents 
across 3 clinic locations over 6 months.

üéØ GOAL: Identify the top 3 factors affecting patient satisfaction to 
present to our executive team

üìè SCOPE - Constraints:
- Focus on actionable insights our clinics can implement
- Results must be statistically significant (p < 0.05)
- 6-month timeframe across 3 clinic locations
- Use Tableau for data visualization (required by our organization)

üë• AUDIENCE: Non-technical executives who need clear, actionable insights
- Prefer visual presentations over raw statistics
- Need to understand business impact

üí° EXAMPLES: Current approach includes basic satisfaction scores, but 
executives have requested deeper analysis linking satisfaction to specific 
operational factors

Question: What analysis approach would you recommend, and what 
visualization types should I use for the executive presentation?
```

<Check>
This structure applies all four context-setting techniques: **stating your goal** üéØ, **defining your audience** üë•, **setting the scope** üìè, and **providing relevant examples** üí°.
</Check>

## Structured Output Requests

Requesting specific formats helps you get responses that are immediately usable.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Lists and Bullet Points" icon="list">
Request organized information in scannable format.

**Example:**
```
List the 5 most important considerations when choosing a database 
for a real-time analytics platform. For each point:
- State the consideration
- Explain why it matters
- Provide one concrete example
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tables and Comparisons" icon="table">
Get side-by-side comparisons for decision-making.

**Example:**
```
Create a comparison table of React, Vue, and Angular with these columns:
- Framework name
- Learning curve (easy/moderate/steep)
- Best use case
- Community size
- Enterprise adoption
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step-by-Step Instructions" icon="list-ol">
Request procedures in sequential format.

**Example:**
```
Provide step-by-step instructions to set up CI/CD for a Node.js 
application using GitHub Actions. Include:
1. Prerequisites needed
2. Each configuration step
3. How to verify each step worked
4. Common troubleshooting tips
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Code Examples" icon="code">
Request working code with explanations.

**Example:**
```

## Prompt Engineering

Advanced strategies for crafting prompts that consistently deliver high-quality, targeted responses:

- **Iterative refinement** ‚Äì Start simple, evaluate, and refine based on responses
- **Building on responses** ‚Äì Use previous answers to go deeper
- **Assign roles** ‚Äì Give the AI a specific perspective or expertise
- **Use constraints** ‚Äì Set clear boundaries for format and scope

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Iterative refinement" icon="arrows-rotate">
Don't expect perfection on the first try. Refine your prompts based on the responses you receive.

<Steps>
<Step title="Start with a basic prompt">
Begin with a clear but simple question.

```
Explain how context windows work in AI models.
```
</Step>

<Step title="Evaluate the response">
Assess whether the response matches your needs. Too technical? Too vague? Wrong focus?
</Step>

<Step title="Refine and add specificity">
Adjust your prompt based on what was missing.

```
Explain how context windows work in AI models in simple terms. 
Use an analogy to help a non-technical person understand, and 
explain why this matters for everyday AI users.
```
</Step>

<Step title="Iterate until satisfied">
Continue refining until you get the response quality you need.

<Check>
Each iteration helps you learn what works best for different types of questions.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Building on responses" icon="comments">
Use the AI's previous answer to go deeper or pivot your inquiry.

**Pattern:**
```
First prompt: "Explain the benefits of microservices architecture."

Follow-up: "You mentioned scalability as a key benefit. Can you provide 
a concrete example of how microservices enabled scalability for a company 
handling rapid growth?"

Further follow-up: "Given those scalability benefits, what are the main 
challenges small teams face when adopting microservices?"
```

<Tip>
This conversational approach helps you explore topics naturally while maintaining focus.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Assign roles for perspective" icon="user-tie">
Assign the AI a specific role or expertise to shape its approach and tone.

**Example:**
```
You are an experienced DevOps engineer with expertise in Kubernetes. 
Review this deployment configuration and identify potential security 
vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.

[Your configuration here]
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use constraints effectively" icon="sliders">
Set clear boundaries to guide the AI's response format and scope.

**Example:**
```
Analyze this dataset with the following constraints:
- Focus only on Q4 2024 data
- Exclude outliers beyond 2 standard deviations
- Present findings in order of business impact
- Include statistical confidence levels
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

This section provides a quick overview of more sophisticated techniques. For deeper understanding and implementation details, explore comprehensive resources on prompt engineering.

- **Chain-of-thought prompting** ‚Äì Request step-by-step reasoning for complex problems
- **Few-shot learning** ‚Äì Provide examples of the pattern you want
- **Zero-shot prompting** ‚Äì Ask for tasks without examples when straightforward
- **Prompt chaining** ‚Äì Break complex tasks into sequential prompts
- **Template creation** ‚Äì Build reusable prompts for recurring tasks
- **Using tools** ‚Äì Explicitly request tool usage when available

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Chain-of-thought prompting" icon="list-ol">
Encourage step-by-step reasoning for complex problems by explicitly requesting the AI to show its work.

**Example:**
```
Solve this problem step-by-step, explaining your reasoning at each stage:

Our e-commerce site has a 68% cart abandonment rate. Average cart 
value is $120. We have 50,000 monthly visitors with a 12% add-to-cart 
rate. Calculate the potential monthly revenue increase if we reduce 
abandonment to 55%, and explain what interventions might achieve this.

Show your calculations and reasoning for each step.
```

**Why it works:** Explicitly requesting step-by-step reasoning activates more thorough processing and makes it easier to verify the logic.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Few-shot learning" icon="graduation-cap">
Provide examples of the input-output pattern you want the AI to follow.

**Example:**
```
I'll show you examples of customer feedback and how I want them 
categorized, then you categorize new feedback the same way:

Example 1:
Feedback: "The app crashes every time I try to upload photos"
Category: Bug - Critical
Sentiment: Frustrated
Action: Escalate to engineering

Example 2:
Feedback: "Love the new dark mode! Makes it easier to use at night"
Category: Feature feedback - Positive
Sentiment: Satisfied
Action: Share with product team

Example 3:
Feedback: "It would be great if we could export data to CSV"
Category: Feature request
Sentiment: Neutral
Action: Add to feature backlog

Now categorize this feedback:
"The search function doesn't find exact matches sometimes"
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Zero-shot prompting" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
Ask the AI to perform tasks without examples when the task is straightforward.

**Best for:**
- Well-defined tasks with clear expectations
- Common operations (summarization, translation, classification)
- When you want unbiased responses without influence from examples

**Example:**
```
Translate the following English text to French, maintaining the 
professional tone:

[Your text here]
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prompt chaining" icon="link">
Break complex tasks into multiple prompts, using output from one as input to the next.

**Example sequence:**
```
Prompt 1: "Extract all customer pain points mentioned in these 
support tickets: [tickets]"

Prompt 2: "Take these pain points: [output from prompt 1] 
and group them into themes."

Prompt 3: "For each theme: [output from prompt 2], suggest 
one product improvement that addresses multiple pain points."
```

**Why chain prompts:**
- Handles complex multi-stage tasks more reliably
- Allows you to verify intermediate outputs
- Easier to debug when something goes wrong
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Template creation" icon="file-code">
Develop reusable prompt templates for recurring tasks. Save them in the [Prompt Library](/improved-usage/prompt-library) for easy access.

**Template Example:**
```
Analyze this {{document_type}} for a {{target_audience}} audience.

Document:
{{content}}

Provide:
1. Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Key insights (3-5 bullet points)
3. Recommended actions
4. Potential risks or considerations

Format: {{output_format:bullets|paragraphs|table}}
```

<Info>
See the [Prompt Library](/improved-usage/prompt-library) page for comprehensive guidance on creating and managing reusable prompts with variables.
</Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using tools in prompts" icon="wrench">
When working with AI agents that have access to tools (like WonkaChat with MCP connections), you can explicitly request tool usage in your prompts.

**Example:**
```
Use the database connection tool to query our customer table and find 
all customers who signed up in the last 30 days but haven't made a 
purchase. Then analyze the data and suggest targeted retention strategies.
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Being Too Vague">
**Problem:** "Tell me about AI."

**Better:** "Explain the key differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning for a business analyst evaluating which approach to use for customer segmentation."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Asking Multiple Questions at Once">
**Problem:** "How do I improve our SEO, should we use social media ads, and what content strategy works best for B2B?"

**Better:** Break into separate, focused prompts or explicitly request separate treatment of each question.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Providing No Context">
**Problem:** "Is this a good approach?" [without explaining what 'this' is or what your goals are]

**Better:** Provide the approach, your context, your goals, and criteria for "good."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Assuming Prior Knowledge">
**Problem:** Starting a new conversation with "Continue from where we left off" without re-establishing context.

**Why this fails:** AI models cannot access information from previous conversations. Each new conversation starts with an empty context window, so the AI has no way to retrieve or reference what was discussed before.

<Info>
Learn more about context windows and how they work in [Conversation Management](/improved-usage/conversation-management).
</Info>

**Better:** Briefly summarize relevant context from previous conversations when starting a new chat.
