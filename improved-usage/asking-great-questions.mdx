Getting high-quality responses from AI models starts with well-crafted questions. This guide progresses from basic principles to advanced techniques, helping you continuously improve your prompting skills.

<Info>
The quality of AI responses directly correlates with the clarity and structure of your prompts. Small improvements in how you ask questions can dramatically improve results.
</Info>

## Basic Prompting Principles

The foundation of effective AI interaction:

- **Be clear and specific** ‚Äì Vague questions produce vague answers
- **Use positive instructions** ‚Äì Focus on what you want, not what you don't want  
- **Provide context** ‚Äì Give relevant background information to tailor responses

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Be clear and specific" icon="bullseye">
The more specific your request, the better the response.

**Instead of:**
```
Tell me about marketing.
```

**Try:**
```
Explain the three most effective digital marketing strategies for 
a B2B SaaS company with a $10,000 monthly budget.
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use positive instructions" icon="check">
Focus on what you want the AI to do, rather than what you don't want.

**Instead of:**
```
Don't be too technical.
```

**Try:**
```
Explain this in simple terms that a non-technical business owner 
would understand.
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Provide context" icon="circle-info">
Give the AI relevant background information to tailor its response.

**Example:**
```
I'm a product manager at a fintech startup. We're deciding between 
microservices and monolithic architecture for our MVP. What factors 
should we consider given our 3-month launch timeline and team of 
4 developers?
```

<Tip>
Think of the AI as a knowledgeable colleague who needs context to give you the best advice.

## Context Setting Techniques

Proper context ensures the AI understands your goals, audience, and constraints.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Define Your Audience" icon="users">
Specify who will use or read the response to adjust complexity and tone.
</Card>

<Card title="Set the Scope" icon="bullseye">
Clearly define boundaries to prevent overly broad or narrow responses.
</Card>

<Card title="Provide Examples" icon="lightbulb">
Show examples of what you're looking for to guide the output style.
</Card>

<Card title="State Your Goal" icon="flag-checkered">
Explain what you'll do with the response to get more actionable results.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Effective Context-Setting Pattern

Use this structure to provide comprehensive context:

```
[Role/Perspective]: I'm a [your role] working on [project/task]

[Situation]: Currently, [describe your situation]

üéØ [GOAL]: What I need to achieve

üìè [SCOPE - Constraints]: 
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]
- [Constraint 3]

üë• [AUDIENCE]: Who will use/read this or explain the format the output needs to have

üí° [EXAMPLES]: Relevant examples or current approach (if applicable)

[OUTPUT]: Specify the exact format you want for the answer here. For example, request a table, summary, list of action steps, email draft, or bullet points‚Äîwhatever would be most useful for your people or stakeholders.

[Your specific question]
```

**Example:**
```
Role: I'm a data analyst at a healthcare startup

Situation: We have patient satisfaction survey data from 500 respondents 
across 3 clinic locations over 6 months.

üéØ GOAL: Identify the top 3 factors affecting patient satisfaction to 
present to our executive team

üìè SCOPE - Constraints:
- Focus on actionable insights our clinics can implement
- Results must be statistically significant (p < 0.05)
- 6-month timeframe across 3 clinic locations
- Use Tableau for data visualization (required by our organization)

üë• AUDIENCE: Non-technical executives who need clear, actionable insights
- Prefer visual presentations over raw statistics
- Need to understand business impact

üí° EXAMPLES: Current approach includes basic satisfaction scores, but 
executives have requested deeper analysis linking satisfaction to specific 
operational factors

Output:
Please provide your answer in the following format:

- [Factor Name]: [Brief explanation or insight]
- [Factor Name]: [Brief explanation or insight]
- [Factor Name]: [Brief explanation or insight]

For example:
- Waiting times: How quickly patients are attended impacts satisfaction
- Staff friendliness: Positive staff interactions improve experience
- Clarity of instructions: Patients value clear after-visit information

Question: What analysis approach would you recommend, and what 
visualization types should I use for the executive presentation?
```

<Check>
This structure applies all four context-setting techniques: **stating your goal** üéØ, **defining your audience** üë•, **setting the scope** üìè, and **providing relevant examples** üí°.

## Structured Output Requests

Requesting specific formats helps you get responses that are immediately usable.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Lists and Bullet Points" icon="list">
Request organized information in scannable format.

**Example:**
```
List the 5 most important considerations when choosing a database 
for a real-time analytics platform. For each point:

## Prompt Engineering

Use tailored prompt engineering strategies to get high-quality, targeted responses from AI. Choose the approach that matches your needs and your current experience level.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Basic Strategies">

Master these foundational techniques to consistently get better results:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Iterative refinement" icon="arrows-rotate">
Don't expect the perfect answer on your first try. Adjust your prompt each time based on the previous AI response.

<Steps>
<Step title="Start with a basic prompt">
Begin with a clear but simple question.

```
Explain how context windows work in AI models.
```
</Step>

<Step title="Evaluate the response">
Check if the answer meets your needs. Was it too technical, too vague, or off-topic?
</Step>

<Step title="Refine and add specificity">
Adjust your question to clarify what you want.

```
Explain how context windows work in AI models in simple terms. 
Use an analogy to help a non-technical person understand, and 
explain why this matters for everyday AI users.
```
</Step>

<Step title="Iterate until satisfied">
Repeat this process until the answer matches your needs.

<Check>
You‚Äôll learn what works best for your goals by refining each time.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Building on responses" icon="comments">
Use the AI‚Äôs previous answers as a springboard for further exploration or greater depth.

**Pattern:**
```
First prompt: "Explain the benefits of microservices architecture."

Follow-up: "You mentioned scalability as a key benefit. Can you provide 
a concrete example of how microservices enabled scalability for a company 
handling rapid growth?"

Further follow-up: "Given those scalability benefits, what are the main 
challenges small teams face when adopting microservices?"
```

<Tip>
This approach leads to more natural, conversational, and productive exploration of complex topics.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Assign roles for perspective" icon="user-tie">
Ask the AI to take on a specific professional or subject matter expert role.

**Example:**
```
You are an experienced DevOps engineer with expertise in Kubernetes. 
Review this deployment configuration and identify potential security 
vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.

[Your configuration here]
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use constraints effectively" icon="sliders">
Clearly specify response rules to limit scope, structure, or style.

**Example:**
```
Analyze this dataset with the following constraints:
- Focus only on Q4 2024 data
- Exclude outliers beyond 2 standard deviations
- Present findings in order of business impact
- Include statistical confidence levels
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Advanced Techniques">

Level up your prompting with these more sophisticated approaches:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Chain-of-thought prompting" icon="list-ol">
Ask for step-by-step reasoning to see how the AI arrives at a solution.

**Example:**
```
Solve this problem step-by-step, explaining your reasoning at each stage:

Our e-commerce site has a 68% cart abandonment rate. Average cart 
value is $120. We have 50,000 monthly visitors with a 12% add-to-cart 
rate. Calculate the potential monthly revenue increase if we reduce 
abandonment to 55%, and explain what interventions might achieve this.

Show your calculations and reasoning for each step.
```

**Why it works:** Step-by-step requests generate more transparent, verifiable answers and reduce mistakes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Few-shot learning" icon="graduation-cap">
Show a few example inputs and the type of answers you expect. The AI will mimic your structure and approach.

**Example:**
```
I'll show you examples of customer feedback and how I want them 
categorized, then you categorize new feedback the same way:

Example 1:
Feedback: "The app crashes every time I try to upload photos"
Category: Bug - Critical
Sentiment: Frustrated
Action: Escalate to engineering

Example 2:
Feedback: "Love the new dark mode! Makes it easier to use at night"
Category: Feature feedback - Positive
Sentiment: Satisfied
Action: Share with product team

Example 3:
Feedback: "It would be great if we could export data to CSV"
Category: Feature request
Sentiment: Neutral
Action: Add to feature backlog

Now categorize this feedback:
"The search function doesn't find exact matches sometimes"
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Zero-shot prompting" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
Use this when your task is simple and expectations are obvious‚Äîno examples needed.

**Best for:**
- Clear tasks like summarization, translation, or classification
- When you want unbiased answers

**Example:**
```
Translate the following English text to French, maintaining the 
professional tone:

[Your text here]
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prompt chaining" icon="link">
Break bigger challenges into smaller, sequential prompts. Use the output from one step as the input to the next.

**Example sequence:**
```
Prompt 1: "Extract all customer pain points mentioned in these 
support tickets: [tickets]"

Prompt 2: "Take these pain points: [output from prompt 1] 
and group them into themes."

Prompt 3: "For each theme: [output from prompt 2], suggest 
one product improvement that addresses multiple pain points."
```

**Why chain prompts:** 
- Breaks up complex tasks
- Lets you check (and fix) partial steps
- Increases accuracy on multi-stage workflows
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Template creation" icon="file-code">
Save time by building your own prompt templates for tasks you repeat often. Store them in the [Prompt Library](/improved-usage/prompt-library).

**Template Example:**
```
Analyze this {{document_type}} for a {{target_audience}} audience.

Document:
{{content}}

Provide:
1. Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Key insights (3-5 bullet points)
3. Recommended actions
4. Potential risks or considerations

Format: {{output_format:bullets|paragraphs|table}}
```

<Info>
For details on managing and sharing prompts, see the [Prompt Library](/improved-usage/prompt-library).
</Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using tools in prompts" icon="wrench">
Direct the AI to use plugins or integrations when available, like business data connectors.

**Example:**
```
Use the database connection tool to query our customer table and find 
all customers who signed up in the last 30 days but haven't made a 
purchase. Then analyze the data and suggest targeted retention strategies.
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Being Too Vague">
**Problem:** "Tell me about AI."

**Better:** "Explain the key differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning for a business analyst evaluating which approach to use for customer segmentation."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Asking Multiple Questions at Once">
**Problem:** "How do I improve our SEO, should we use social media ads, and what content strategy works best for B2B?"

**Better:** Break into separate, focused prompts or explicitly request separate treatment of each question.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Providing No Context">
**Problem:** "Is this a good approach?" [without explaining what 'this' is or what your goals are]

**Better:** Provide the approach, your context, your goals, and criteria for "good."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Assuming Prior Knowledge">
**Problem:** Starting a new conversation with "Continue from where we left off" without re-establishing context.

**Why this fails:** AI models cannot access information from previous conversations. Each new conversation starts with an empty context window, so the AI has no way to retrieve or reference what was discussed before.

<Info>
Learn more about context windows and how they work in [Conversation Management](/improved-usage/conversation-management).
</Info>

**Better:** Briefly summarize relevant context from previous conversations when starting a new chat.
