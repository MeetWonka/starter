WonkaChat uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to connect AI models with your business tools, databases, and software—enabling AI to access real information and take actions on your behalf.

<Info>
MCP is an open protocol that allows AI systems to communicate with external data sources and software tools, in a uniform way. 

Think of it as a universal connector—like USB for AI systems—that allows different AI models and tools to work together seamlessly without custom integrations for each combination.

## What MCP Enables

MCP transforms WonkaChat from a standalone AI assistant into a connected system that orchestrates workflows across your business tools. Instead of just answering questions, WonkaChat can manage calendars, send emails, update CRMs, create documents, and coordinate actions across multiple platforms—all through natural conversation.

### How MCP Works

Instead of building custom connectors for each AI and data source pair, MCP allows all AI clients and data sources to be connected through a single integration.

<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/black-mcp-simple.png" alt="MCP simplifies connections between AI models and business tools" />
</Frame>

**In simple terms:** The AI Client (WonkaChat) sends structured requests through MCP. The MCP Server communicates with your underlying systems (Outlook, GitHub, Odoo, etc.) and sends back a structured response.

<Steps>
<Step title="You connect a tool">
Click the MCP button for any tool (like Outlook, Gmail, or Slack) and provide your credentials once.
</Step>
<Step title="WonkaChat gets secure access">
MCP establishes a secure connection between WonkaChat and your business tools. It works on your behalf using natural language, operating within your existing permissions.

<Warning>
**Important:** WonkaChat inherits your exact permissions. It can only access data and perform actions that you personally have permission to do. If you can't access a file, send an email from a specific account, or modify a record in your regular workflow, WonkaChat can't do it either through MCP.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="You chat naturally">
Ask questions or make requests in plain language. WonkaChat automatically uses the right tools to help you.

```
"What emails did I receive from Sarah this week?"
```

WonkaChat connects to your email via MCP, retrieves the information you asked, and presents it clearly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Risk Management & Security

<Frame caption="MCP acts as a central security checkpoint for all AI interactions">
<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/mcp-best.png" alt="MCP provides centralized security, compliance, and governance for AI systems" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/black-mcp-best.png" alt="MCP provides centralized security, compliance, and governance for AI systems" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
One of the biggest concerns around AI is how it accesses and uses sensitive data.
</Warning>

**MCP addresses this by acting as a security checkpoint for all your AI systems**, tracking every data interaction and enforcing company policies. Think of it as having a detailed log of who accessed what, when, and why—which is essential for regulatory compliance.

### How MCP Protects Your Data

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Central Security Layer" icon="shield-halved">
MCP introduces a central layer through which all AI interactions are channeled. This provides **consistency in security policies**, enabling companies to enforce authentication, authorization, and data masking at the protocol level.

All your AI tools connect through one secure gateway, rather than having separate security implementations for each connection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Controlled AI Behavior" icon="gavel">
MCP aligns AI behavior with internal business policies. Because all capabilities are exposed and managed through the MCP server, companies can define exactly **what an AI system is allowed to do**—and nothing more.

AI systems **can't access sensitive data** or trigger actions they haven't been explicitly granted. Every permission is controlled and auditable.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Complete Audit Trail" icon="clipboard-list">
Every interaction through MCP is logged:
- **Who** accessed the data (user identity)
- **What** data was accessed (resources, actions)
- **When** it happened (timestamps)
- **Why** it was needed (context, request details)

This detailed logging is essential for regulatory compliance and security audits.
</Accordion>

## MCP Architecture Overview

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) that enables secure, two-way connections between AI applications and external data sources.

<Info>
WonkaChat implements MCP as a client, connecting to MCP servers that expose your tools and data to the AI models. Learn more at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
</Info>

### How It Works

MCP uses a **client-server architecture** where WonkaChat acts as the MCP Client, connecting to MCP Servers that integrate with your business tools:

<Frame caption="WonkaChat connects to multiple MCP servers for different types of systems">
<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/wc-mcp.png" alt="WonkaChat MCP architecture diagram" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/black-wc-mcp.png" alt="WonkaChat MCP architecture diagram" />
</Frame>


**Architecture Flow:**
- **WonkaChat (MCP Client)** sends structured requests and manages authentication
- **MCP Server** acts as the integration layer, connecting to external systems
- **External Systems** (Outlook, Odoo, Salesforce, etc.) provide data via their APIs
- All responses flow back through the same secure channel

**Key Technical Benefits:**
- JSON-RPC based communication protocol
- Capability negotiation during initialization
- Clear security boundaries via client-host-server architecture
- User consent mechanisms for AI interactions

### Security Implementation

WonkaChat implements MCP with enterprise-grade security features that build upon the protocol's foundation:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="MCP Protocol Security" icon="shield">
**Built into the Protocol:**
- **User Consent**: All AI actions require explicit user authorization ([MCP Best Practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices))
- **Capability Negotiation**: Clients and servers agree on available features during initialization
- **Token Validation**: Servers only accept tokens explicitly issued for them (OAuth 2.1 framework)
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling to prevent hijacking and impersonation
- **Security Boundaries**: Client-host-server architecture with clear isolation

**Recommended by MCP:**
- Input validation and sanitization for all parameters
- Rate limiting and abuse monitoring
- Secure transport (TLS encryption) for all connections
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WonkaChat's Implementation" icon="lock">
**Authentication & Access Control:**
- OAuth 2.0 for third-party services (Google, Microsoft, Salesforce)
- API key authentication for developer tools
- Token encryption at rest (AES-256) with automatic refresh
- Per-user token storage with complete isolation
- Users inherit only their existing tool permissions

**Enterprise Security:**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at organizational level
- Centralized security policies across all MCP connections
- Connection timeouts and resource protection
- Multi-region deployment with secure failover
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audit & Compliance" icon="clipboard-list">
**WonkaChat's Audit Trail:**

<Warning>
WonkaChat operates within your existing security perimeter and never stores your business data—only encrypted authentication tokens.
</Warning>

### Enterprise Considerations

**Custom Integrations**

For organizations with proprietary systems, WonkaChat can integrate custom MCP servers:
- Our team handles the technical implementation
- Deploy in your infrastructure for complete data control
- Maintain custom security policies and data residency requirements

**MCP vs Traditional APIs**

MCP provides a strategic advantage over point-to-point API integrations:
