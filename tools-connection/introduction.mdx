While **you don't need to understand the technical details to use them**, you can learn more in the [Technical Details](#technical-details) section if you're curious.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="WonkaChat gets secure access">
A secure connection is established between WonkaChat and your business tools. WonkaChat works on your behalf using natural language, operating within your existing permissions.

<Warning>
**Important:** WonkaChat inherits your exact permissions. It can only access data and perform actions that you personally have permission to do. If you can't access a file, send an email from a specific account, or modify a record in your regular workflow, WonkaChat can't do it either.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Chat naturally">
Ask questions or make requests in plain language. WonkaChat automatically uses the right tools to help you.

```
"What emails did I receive from Sarah this week?"
```

WonkaChat connects to your email, retrieves the information, and presents it clearly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## The Difference External Connections (MCP) Make

Connecting your tools dramatically changes what WonkaChat can accomplish. Here's a real example showing the difference:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Without Connections">

**Your request:**
```
"Schedule a meeting with the marketing team for next Tuesday at 2 PM to discuss the Q2 campaign results."
```

**WonkaChat's response (limited):**
```
I can help you draft a meeting invitation, but I cannot access your calendar 
or email system to actually schedule the meeting. 

Here's what I suggest:
1. Check your calendar for availability on Tuesday at 2 PM
2. Send a meeting invite to your marketing team
3. Include "Q2 Campaign Results Discussion" as the subject

Would you like me to draft the meeting invitation text for you?
```

<Warning>
Without connections, WonkaChat can only provide general guidance and cannot access your actual data or take real actions.
</Warning>

</Tab>

<Tab title="With Connections">

**Your request:**
```
"Schedule a meeting with the marketing team for next Tuesday at 2 PM to discuss the Q2 campaign results."
```

**WonkaChat's response (powerful):**
```
I'll schedule that meeting for you.

Checking your calendar... Tuesday at 2 PM is available.

Looking up "marketing team" members... Found 5 team members:
- Sarah Johnson (Marketing Director)
- Mike Chen (Content Lead)  
- Emma Rodriguez (Social Media Manager)
- David Kim (Analytics Specialist)
- Lisa Wang (Designer)

Creating meeting invite with:
- Title: "Q2 Campaign Results Discussion"
- Time: Tuesday, October 21, 2025 at 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM
- Location: Conference Room B (reserved)
- Attendees: All 5 marketing team members

✓ Meeting scheduled and invitations sent.
✓ Conference room reserved.
✓ Calendar updated.

Is there anything else you'd like me to add to the meeting?
```

<Check>
With connections, WonkaChat accesses your real calendar, identifies team members, checks room availability, and completes the entire task automatically.
</Check>

## Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

WonkaChat uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to connect AI models with your business tools, databases, and software, enabling AI to access real information and take actions on your behalf.

<Info>
MCP is an open protocol that allows AI systems to communicate with external data sources and software tools in a uniform way. 

Think of it as a universal connector (like USB for AI systems) that allows different AI models and tools to work together seamlessly without custom integrations for each combination.
</Info>

### How MCP Works

Instead of building custom connectors for each AI and data source pair, MCP allows all AI clients and data sources to be connected through a single integration.

<Frame caption="Before and after MCP - from fragmented connections to unified protocol">
<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/mcp-simple.png" alt="MCP simplifies connections between AI models and business tools" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/black-mcp-simple.png" alt="MCP simplifies connections between AI models and business tools" />
</Frame>

**In simple terms:** The AI Client (WonkaChat) sends structured requests through MCP. The MCP Server communicates with your underlying systems (Outlook, GitHub, Odoo, etc.) and sends back a structured response.

## Risk Management & Security

<Frame caption="MCP acts as a central security checkpoint for all AI interactions">
<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/mcp-best.png" alt="MCP provides centralized security, compliance, and governance for AI systems" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/black-mcp-best.png" alt="MCP provides centralized security, compliance, and governance for AI systems" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
One of the biggest concerns around AI is how it accesses and uses sensitive data.
</Warning>

**MCP addresses this by acting as a security checkpoint for all your AI systems**, tracking every data interaction and enforcing company policies. Think of it as having a detailed log of who accessed what, when, and why, which is essential for regulatory compliance.

### How MCP Protects Your Data

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Central Security Layer" icon="shield-halved">
MCP introduces a central layer through which all AI interactions are channeled. This provides **consistency in security policies**, enabling companies to enforce authentication, authorization, and data masking at the protocol level.

All your AI tools connect through one secure gateway, rather than having separate security implementations for each connection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Controlled AI Behavior" icon="gavel">
MCP aligns AI behavior with internal business policies. Because all capabilities are exposed and managed through the MCP server, companies can define exactly **what an AI system is allowed to do** and nothing more.

AI systems **can't access sensitive data** or trigger actions they haven't been explicitly granted. Every permission is controlled and auditable.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Complete Audit Trail" icon="clipboard-list">
Every interaction through MCP is logged:
- **Who** accessed the data (user identity)
- **What** data was accessed (resources, actions)
- **When** it happened (timestamps)
- **Why** it was needed (context, request details)

This detailed logging is essential for regulatory compliance and security audits.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## MCP Architecture Overview

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) that enables secure, two-way connections between AI applications and external data sources.

<Info>
WonkaChat implements MCP as a client, connecting to MCP servers that expose your tools and data to the AI models. Learn more at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
</Info>

### Technical Implementation

MCP uses a **client-server architecture** where WonkaChat acts as the MCP Client, connecting to MCP Servers that integrate with your business tools:

<Frame caption="WonkaChat connects to multiple MCP servers for different types of systems">
<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/wc-mcp.png" alt="WonkaChat MCP architecture diagram" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/black-wc-mcp.png" alt="WonkaChat MCP architecture diagram" />
</Frame>


**Architecture Flow:**
- **WonkaChat (MCP Client)** sends structured requests and manages authentication
- **MCP Server** acts as the integration layer, connecting to external systems
- **External Systems** (Outlook, Odoo, Salesforce, etc.) provide data via their APIs
- All responses flow back through the same secure channel

**Key Technical Benefits:**
- JSON-RPC based communication protocol
- Capability negotiation during initialization
- Clear security boundaries via client-host-server architecture
- User consent mechanisms for AI interactions

### Security Implementation

WonkaChat implements MCP with enterprise-grade security features that build upon the protocol's foundation:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="MCP Protocol Security" icon="shield">
**Built into the Protocol:**
- **User Consent**: All AI actions require explicit user authorization ([MCP Best Practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices))
- **Capability Negotiation**: Clients and servers agree on available features during initialization
- **Token Validation**: Servers only accept tokens explicitly issued for them (OAuth 2.1 framework)
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling to prevent hijacking and impersonation
- **Security Boundaries**: Client-host-server architecture with clear isolation

**Recommended by MCP:**
- Input validation and sanitization for all parameters
- Rate limiting and abuse monitoring
- Secure transport (TLS encryption) for all connections
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WonkaChat's Implementation" icon="lock">
**Authentication & Access Control:**
- OAuth 2.0 for third-party services (Google, Microsoft, Salesforce)
- API key authentication for developer tools
- Token encryption at rest (AES-256) with automatic refresh
- Per-user token storage with complete isolation
- Users inherit only their existing tool permissions

**Enterprise Security:**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at organizational level
- Centralized security policies across all MCP connections
- Connection timeouts and resource protection
- Multi-region deployment with secure failover
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audit & Compliance" icon="clipboard-list">
**WonkaChat's Audit Trail:**
<Info>
Detailed audit and compliance features documentation coming soon.

These are WonkaChat implementation features, not built into the MCP protocol itself.
