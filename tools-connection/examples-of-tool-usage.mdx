## Tips for Effective Tool Usage

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Start with Simple Queries" icon="seedling">
When you first connect a tool:

1. **Test basic access**: "Show me my recent items"
2. **Verify permissions**: Try read operations before write operations
3. **Explore capabilities**: Ask "What can you do with [tool]?"
4. **Gradually increase complexity**: Start simple, then combine operations

<Tip>
Don't worry about getting the query perfect. Just describe what you want in natural language—the AI will figure out the right tool operations.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Be Specific When Needed" icon="crosshairs">
While AI handles natural language well, specific details improve results:

**Less Specific:**
```
"Show me emails"
```
Result: May return too many results or default to today

**More Specific:**
```
"Show me unread emails from my manager this week"
```
Result: Precisely filtered results

**Even More Specific:**
```
"Find emails from john@company.com with 'budget' in subject, received in the last 30 days"
```
Result: Exactly what you need
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Time Constraints" icon="clock">
Adding time boundaries improves performance and relevance:

- "today" / "this week" / "this month"
- "in the last 7 days"
- "between January 1 and January 31"
- "after March 15th"
- "before the end of Q2"

**Example:**
```
"Show me Slack messages in #engineering from yesterday"
```
Much faster than querying all messages ever sent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Leverage Multi-Step Requests" icon="list-ol">
You can ask AI to perform multiple operations in sequence:

```
"Check my calendar for availability tomorrow afternoon, 
then email those times to sarah@company.com"
```

AI will:
1. Connect to calendar MCP
2. Find available slots
3. Connect to email MCP
4. Draft and send email

**No need to break it into separate queries!**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Review Before Action" icon="eye">
For operations that modify data (send, create, update, delete):

- Ask the AI to show you a preview
- Review carefully before confirming
- You can ask for changes: "Make the email more formal"
- Always verify recipient addresses and critical data
- Explicitly tell the AI not to perform certain actions if needed: "Don't send this yet, just show me the draft"

<Warning>
Some actions (like sending emails or creating orders) may be irreversible. Double-check before confirming AI to proceed.
</Warning>
