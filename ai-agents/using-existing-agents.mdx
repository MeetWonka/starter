description: "Get the best results from pre-built agents by understanding their capabilities and working with their instructions."
---

Pre-built agents come configured with specific instructions, tools, and expertise. Understanding how they work helps you interact with them effectively.

<Info>
Each agent has a defined role that shapes all responses. You don't need to repeat context the agent already has.

## Working with Agents

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Getting Started">

### Understanding Agent Instructions

Agents have persistent instructions that define:
- **Role**: Primary function and expertise area
- **Tone**: Communication style (formal, casual, technical)
- **Business context**: Company information and policies
- **Tool access**: Which MCP connections the agent uses

<Check>
Agents apply their instructions automatically—no need to explain their role or provide context they already have.
</Check>

## Getting the Best Results

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose the Right Agent">
Select an agent whose role matches your task. Read descriptions to understand capabilities.
</Step>

<Step title="Be Specific">
State your needs clearly. Provide relevant details like names, dates, or specific requirements.

**Example:** "Generate Q4 report for EMEA region, focusing on enterprise customers, formatted as a presentation deck."
</Step>

<Step title="Trust the Instructions">
Let agents apply their configured expertise. Don't override their role with contradictory instructions.
</Step>

<Step title="Iterate">
If the first response isn't perfect, provide specific feedback about what to adjust.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Agent Tool Usage

Agents with MCP tool access perform actions automatically:
1. Analyze your request
2. Select necessary tools
3. Execute operations
4. Synthesize results

You don't need to specify which tools to use—agents handle this based on their configuration.

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Agent doesn't have needed information">
**Solution:** Provide the information in your request, or ask an administrator to update the agent's context.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent can't access required tool">
**Solution:** Verify you have personal permissions for the underlying system. Contact administrator if the agent needs different tools.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Response doesn't match expectations">
**Solution:** Read the agent description to understand its configuration. Provide more specific guidance or use a different agent.
</Accordion>

<Card title="Use Appropriate Agents" icon="map-location-dot">
Different agents for different tasks—don't force specialists into unrelated workflows.

## When to Create Your Own Agent

Consider building a personal agent when:
- No existing agent matches your workflow
- You need a unique combination of tools
- Your task requires specialized instructions
- You want customized tone or style

<Info>
See [Creating Your First Agent](/ai-agents/creating-your-first-agent) to build custom agents.

## System Prompt Architecture

Agents operate based on their system prompt—comprehensive guidelines that persist across all interactions.

**System prompt includes:**
- Role definition and expertise
- Operational guidelines and decision frameworks
- Tool usage instructions
- Output formatting standards
- Error handling procedures
- Guardrails and constraints

<Info>
System prompts are foundational. Unlike conversation messages, they cannot be overridden mid-conversation.
</Info>

---

## Agent Decision-Making

**Execution flow:**
```
User Request → System Prompt Analysis → Task Decomposition → 
Tool Selection → Execution → Result Synthesis → Response
```

The agent interprets all requests through its system prompt, ensuring consistent behavior aligned with its configured role.

---

## Agent Limitations

**Agents cannot:**
- Act outside their defined role (instructions create boundaries)
- Access tools they're not configured with OR that you lack permission to use
- Override their system prompt based on user requests
- Remember previous conversations (each conversation is independent)

<Warning>
Agents follow their system prompt. You can't fundamentally change an agent's behavior mid-conversation.
</Warning>

---

## Optimization Strategies

**Align with agent expertise:**
Frame requests using terminology from the agent's domain.

**Provide structured input:**
```
Task: Quarterly business review
Region: APAC
Metrics: Revenue, Customer Acquisition, Churn
Format: Executive presentation
```

**Leverage conversation continuity:**
- Initial request: Broad task definition
- Agent response: First-pass results
- Your refinement: Specific adjustments
- Agent iteration: Updated results

---

## Performance Indicators

**Good agent performance:**
- Responses consistent with defined role and tone
- Appropriate tool selection and usage
- Accurate application of business context
- Clear error handling when operations fail

<Warning>
If an agent consistently underperforms, report to your administrator for potential reconfiguration.
