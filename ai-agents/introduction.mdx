AI agents are specialized AI assistants with persistent instructions and dedicated tool access that deliver consistent, reliable results.

<Info>
Agents are like AI team members with specific roles and expertise—they remember their job across all conversations.

## How Agents Differ from Regular Chat

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Getting Started">

Regular chat starts fresh each time. Agents have persistent instructions, roles, and tools that apply automatically to every conversation.

**Key advantages:**

## When to Use Agents

Use agents for:
- **Recurring workflows**: Tasks you perform regularly with consistent requirements
- **Specialized expertise**: Domain-specific knowledge applied consistently  
- **Cross-tool workflows**: Complex tasks spanning multiple systems
- **Team standardization**: Shared workflows across your organization

## Agent Architecture

Agents are built on three core components:

### Core Components

**1. Model**: AI model powering reasoning and decision-making. Choose based on task complexity and cost.

**2. Tools**: MCP integrations for data retrieval and actions across connected systems.

**3. System Prompt**: Instructions defining role, behavior, tone, and operational guidelines. This persists across all conversations.

---

## Execution Loop

Agents run autonomously: analyze request → select tools → execute → synthesize results → respond or continue until task complete.

---

## Agent Patterns

**Single-agent**: One agent with multiple tools. Start here for most use cases.

**Multi-agent**: Multiple specialized agents coordinate for complex workflows. Use only when single-agent instructions become unwieldy or too many similar tools cause selection issues.

---

## Model Selection

**Thinking models** (o1, Claude Opus): Complex reasoning, nuanced decisions, ambiguous situations  
**Non-thinking models** (GPT-4, Claude Sonnet): Quick responses, straightforward tasks, cost-effective

Match model capability to task complexity.

---

## Security

Agents inherit your permissions—they can only access what you can access. Administrators control tool access and sharing. All actions are logged. See [Security & Governance](/security-governance/access-control) for details.
