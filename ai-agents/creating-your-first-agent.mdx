Create specialized AI agents tailored to your workflows. This guide covers agent creation from initial setup through deployment.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Getting Started">

<Info>
Building an agent means defining its role, writing instructions, selecting a model, and optionally connecting tools.
</Info>

---

## Before You Begin

Define your agent's purpose:
- **What task** will this agent handle?
- **Who will use it** (personal or organization-wide)?
- **How complex** is the workflow?
- **Which tools** does it need?

---

## Agent Creation Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Agent Creation">
Navigate to the agent creation interface and click "Create New Agent."

<Frame caption="Agent creation interface">
<img src="/images/agent-creation-start.png" alt="Agent creation starting point" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Name Your Agent">
Choose a clear, descriptive name that indicates purpose.

**Good:** "Customer Support Assistant," "Q4 Sales Data Analyzer"  
**Avoid:** "Helper," "Agent 1"

<Tip>
If planning organization-wide sharing, choose names that make sense to all users.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Write Instructions">
Instructions define your agent's role, expertise, tone, and behavior.

### Instructions Template

```
You are a [role] for [company/context].

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
WonkaChat is model-agnosticâ€”choose from various providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) based on your needs.
</Info>

<Tip>
Start with a capable model, then test if a simpler model achieves acceptable results for cost optimization.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect Tools (Optional)">
Add MCP tools if your agent needs to interact with external systems.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Data Tools" icon="database">
Retrieve information from CRMs, databases, documents, knowledge bases.
</Card>

<Card title="Action Tools" icon="bolt">
Send emails, update records, create entries, trigger workflows.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

**Tool selection principles:**
- Only add tools the agent actually needs
- Too many tools can cause selection confusion
- Ensure you have permissions for assigned tools

<Warning>
Agents can only use tools you personally have permission to access.
</Warning>

**Example configurations:**
- **Customer Support:** CRM, ticket system, knowledge base, email
- **Data Analysis:** Database connections, visualization, spreadsheets
- **Content:** Document storage, publishing platform, asset library
</Step>

<Step title="Review and Test">
Test thoroughly before deployment.

**Test:**
- Core functionality with typical requests
- Edge cases and incomplete information
- Error handling when tools fail
- Consistency across multiple similar requests

<Check>
Thorough testing ensures users get reliable results.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy or Share">
**Personal use:** Start using immediately, refine based on real usage

**Organization sharing:** Contact administrator, provide context on purpose and value, await review and approval

<Info>
See [Access Control](/security-governance/access-control) for agent sharing details.

## Common Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Vague Instructions">
**Problem:** "You are a helpful assistant" lacks guidance.  
**Solution:** Be specific about role, expertise, tone, and guidelines.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Too Many Responsibilities">
**Problem:** One agent handling unrelated tasks.  
**Solution:** Create focused agents for specific workflows.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool Overload">
**Problem:** Assigning every available tool.  
**Solution:** Only add necessary tools to avoid selection confusion.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient Testing">
**Problem:** Deploying without thorough testing.  
**Solution:** Test extensively with realistic scenarios first.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Refining Your Agent

After deployment:
1. Monitor performance and note issues
2. Identify recurring problems
3. Update instructions to address issues
4. Test changes
5. Document learnings for future agents

<Tip>
The best agents evolve through continuous refinement based on real-world usage.

## System Prompt Engineering

The system prompt (instructions) shapes all agent behavior. Effective prompts have clear structure:

```
[Role Definition]
You are a [specific role] with [relevant expertise].

[Core Responsibilities]
1. [Primary function]
2. [Secondary function]

[Decision-Making Framework]
When [condition], do [action].
For [scenario], follow [procedure].

[Communication Guidelines]
- Tone and style requirements
- Formatting standards

[Tool Usage Instructions]
Use [tool] when [condition].
Prefer [approach] for [situation].

[Guardrails]
Never [prohibited action].
Always [required behavior].
Escalate when [escalation criteria].
```

## Model Selection Strategy

**Performance vs Cost:**

1. **Establish baseline** with capable model
2. **Test with smaller models** to check performance
3. **Measure metrics**: accuracy, tool selection, response quality
4. **Optimize iteratively**: replace only where quality remains acceptable

<Tip>
Use capable models during development, then optimize for cost in production if performance allows.
</Tip>

## Model Parameters

<Frame caption="Model configuration parameters">
<img src="/images/model-parameters.png" alt="Advanced model configuration" />
</Frame>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Temperature (0.0-1.0)">
Controls randomness. Lower = more deterministic.

**Recommended:**
- **0.0-0.3**: Factual tasks, data analysis
- **0.4-0.7**: Balanced (default)
- **0.8-1.0**: Creative writing, brainstorming
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Top P (0.0-1.0)">
Controls diversity. Lower = more focused.

<Info>
Adjust either temperature OR top_p, not both simultaneously.
</Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Frequency Penalty (0.0-1.0)">
Reduces repetition based on token frequency.

Use when agent responses are overly repetitive.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Presence Penalty (0.0-1.0)">
Encourages discussing new topics rather than revisiting covered ones.

Use for comprehensive topic coverage.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Default parameters work well for most agents. Only adjust when specific issues arise. Change one parameter at a time.
</Warning>

## Advanced Instruction Patterns

### Conditional Logic

```
When user requests [action type]:
1. First verify [precondition]
2. If [condition A], proceed with [workflow A]
3. If [condition B], use [workflow B]
4. Otherwise, ask for [specific details]

For high-value transactions (>$1000):
- Require additional verification
- Document decision rationale
```

### Tool Usage Optimization

```
Tool Selection Guidelines:

Primary data source: database_query
Fallback: If database unavailable, use CRM_api

For email operations:
- Simple notifications: email_tool
- Template communications: email_template_tool
- Bulk: email_batch_tool

Always prefer:
- Read before write operations
- Specific queries over broad searches
```

---

## When to Split into Multiple Agents

Consider creating separate agents when:
- Instructions have many conditional branches
- Agent struggles to select from many similar tools
- Responsibilities span multiple unrelated domains
- Single-agent testing reveals consistent issues

<Info>
Start with single agents. Split only when complexity becomes unwieldy.
</Info>

---

## Security Guardrails

Build safe agents with proper guardrails:

**Input validation:**
- Verify user authority for requested actions
- Validate parameters within acceptable ranges
- Confirm request aligns with agent scope

**Output verification:**
- Ensure no sensitive data exposure
- Verify brand guideline alignment
- Confirm actions were authorized

**Tool safeguards:**
- Require confirmation for high-risk tools
- Log all actions for audit
- Implement rate limiting
- Set maximum impact thresholds

<Info>
See [Security & Governance](/security-governance/security-overview) for comprehensive security practices.
