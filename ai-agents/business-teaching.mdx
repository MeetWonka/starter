description: "Provide business context to agents for accurate, company-specific responses."
---

Teaching your business context to agents ensures they understand your company's terminology, processes, and policies. This enables agents to deliver responses grounded in your actual operations instead of relying on generic assumptions.

<Info>
Business teaching helps agents use your exact terminology, follow your processes, and align with your company policies.

## Why Teach Your Business Context?

Without business context, agents make generic assumptions. With it, they provide accurate, company-specific responses.

**Example - Writting a customer support email:**

**Without context:** "Most companies offer refunds within 14-30 days. Check your company's specific policy."

**With context:** "Our refund policy allows requests within 30 days, processed in 3-5 business days. Would you like me to initiate one?"

## How to Provide Business Context

### Add Context to Agent Instructions

Include company-specific information directly in agent instructions. Start with essentials and expand as needed.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Voice and Tone Guidelines" icon="message">
Define how agents should communicate to match your brand.

**Example:**
```
Communication style:
- Professional but friendly, never overly casual
- Use active voice and direct language
- Address customers by first name
- Keep responses concise and actionable
```

<Tip>
Include specific phrases to use or avoid. This ensures consistency across all agent interactions.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Terminology and Glossaries" icon="book">
Define company-specific terms, product names, and acronyms.

**Example:**
```
Key terms:
- "Premium tier" = enterprise subscription level
- "Quick-start" = our 15-minute onboarding process
- MRR = Monthly Recurring Revenue
- CS = Customer Success (not Customer Support)
```

Clear definitions prevent misunderstandings and ensure agents use your language.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Policy Integration" icon="shield">
Include relevant policies so agents can answer questions accurately.

**Example:**
```
Key policies:
- Refunds: Full refund within 30 days, processed in 3-5 business days
- Support hours: 9 AM-6 PM EST, Monday-Friday
- Response SLA: 4 business hours for standard, 1 hour for enterprise
- Escalation: Issues over \$500 require manager approval
```

<Warning>
Always verify agents apply policies correctly before deploying to your team. Test with realistic scenarios.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Process Instructions" icon="list-check">
Document step-by-step workflows agents should follow.

**Example:**
```
Customer onboarding process:
1. Send welcome email with login credentials
2. Schedule orientation call within 48 hours
3. Assign dedicated success manager
4. Provide access to training materials
5. Follow up after 7 days
```

Clear processes ensure consistency and completeness in agent actions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Best practice:** Update instructions when policies or processes change. Outdated context leads to incorrect information.

### Upload Documents for Deep Context

For extensive information like product documentation, policy manuals, or knowledge bases, upload documents that agents can automatically search and reference when answering questions.

<Frame caption="Upload documents for agent context">
<img src="/images/agent-document-upload.png" alt="Document upload interface" />
</Frame>

**Why upload documents?**
- Agents can access detailed information without cluttering instructions
- Perfect for comprehensive documentation that's too large for instructions
- Information stays current by updating documents anytime without changing agent instructions

**Best for:** Product documentation, policy manuals, process guides, training materials, knowledge bases

<Tip>
Use instructions for critical information needed in every response. Use documents for extensive reference material that agents retrieve only when relevant.
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Technical Details: How Document Retrieval Works" icon="gear">

When you upload documents, WonkaChat uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to make them searchable for agents.

**How it works:**

1. **Upload**: You provide company documents
2. **Index**: Documents are processed and made searchable
3. **Retrieve**: When relevant, agents automatically find information from documents
4. **Generate**: Agents produce responses grounded in your actual documentation

**Document preparation tips:**
- **Use clear headings**: Well-structured sections improve retrieval accuracy
- **Keep sections focused**: One topic per section
- **Include context**: Write sections to be understandable independently (e.g., "Our Premium tier (\$99/month) includes..." not just "It includes...")
- **Stay consistent**: Use the same terminology throughout

**Security and privacy:**
- Documents stored securely within your WonkaChat environment
- Never used to train AI models
- Accessible only to users with agent permissions
