## How to Provide Business Context

### 1. Instructions-Based Teaching

Include business context directly in agent instructions.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Company Information">
**Example:**
```
Company background:
- B2B SaaS platform serving mid-market companies
- Product offers project management and team collaboration
- Operate in North America and Europe
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Terminology">
**Example:**
```
Key terms:
- "Premium tier" = enterprise subscription level
- "Quick-start" = 15-minute onboarding process
- MRR = Monthly Recurring Revenue
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Voice and Tone">
**Example:**
```
Communication style:
- Professional but friendly, never overly casual
- Use active voice and direct language
- Address customers by first name
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Policies">
**Example:**
```
Key policies:
- Refunds: Approved within 30 days
- Support hours: 9 AM-6 PM EST, M-F
- Response time: Within 4 business hours
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Processes">
**Example:**
```
Onboarding process:
1. Send welcome email with credentials
2. Schedule orientation within 48 hours
3. Assign success manager
4. Provide training materials
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Start with critical information and add more context as you identify gaps.
</Tip>

---

### 2. Document-Based Teaching

Provide agents with access to company documents for deeper context.

<Frame caption="Upload documents for agent context">
<img src="/images/agent-document-upload.png" alt="Document upload interface" />
</Frame>

**Supported documents:**
- Policy documents
- Process guides and SOPs
- Product documentation
- Training materials
- Knowledge base articles

Agents can reference this information when generating responses, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

---

## Benefits

### Higher Accuracy

**Without business context:**  
"Most companies offer refunds within 14-30 days. Check your company's specific policy."

**With business context:**  
"Our refund policy allows customers to request full refunds within 30 days. Requests are processed within 3-5 business days. Would you like me to initiate a refund?"

### Reduced Hallucinations

Providing factual business information prevents agents from generating incorrect or fabricated details about your company.

<Info>
"Hallucinations" occur when AI generates plausible but incorrect information. Business context significantly reduces this issue.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Start with Essentials" icon="star">
Begin with critical information: terminology, key policies, primary workflows.
</Card>

<Card title="Use Official Sources" icon="file-certificate">
Base context on official documents and approved materials.
</Card>

<Card title="Keep Current" icon="arrows-rotate">
Update agent context when policies or processes change.
</Card>

<Card title="Test" icon="vial">
Verify agents correctly apply business context with realistic requests.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Customer Support">
Product features, support policies, troubleshooting procedures, communication guidelines.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sales and Marketing">
Product positioning, target audience, messaging guidelines, sales processes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="HR and Operations">
Employee policies, onboarding procedures, benefits information, internal processes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data and Analytics">
Business metrics definitions, reporting standards, data sources, analysis frameworks.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Updating Context

Keep agent context current:
1. Monitor agent responses for outdated information
2. Update instructions when policies change
3. Refresh documents with current versions
4. Test updated context

<Warning>
Outdated context causes agents to provide incorrect information. Establish a review schedule.
</Warning>

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

When you provide documents to agents, WonkaChat uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**.

### What is RAG?

RAG combines information retrieval with AI generation:
1. **Retrieve**: Search documents for relevant information
2. **Augment**: Incorporate retrieved information into context
3. **Generate**: Produce responses grounded in retrieved information

<Info>
RAG allows agents to access specific company information without that information being part of the AI model's training data.
</Info>

---

## How RAG Works

**Document processing:**
```
Document → Parse and split into chunks → Generate embeddings → 
Create searchable index → Ready for retrieval
```

**Retrieval during conversations:**
```
User request → Semantic search → Rank relevance → 
Inject context → Generate response
```

<Check>
Users only see responses—the retrieval process is invisible.
</Check>

## RAG vs Instructions

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Instructions">
**Best for:**
- Critical information needed in every response
- Policy constraints and operational rules
- Tone, voice, communication style
- Information that rarely changes

**Characteristics:**
- Always included in agent context
- Limited by system prompt size
- Best for concise, structured information

**Example:**
"Always verify account before sharing sensitive details. Escalate refunds over $500."
</Tab>

<Tab title="RAG Documents">
**Best for:**
- Large volumes of reference information
- Detailed product documentation
- Extensive policy documents
- Frequently updated content

**Characteristics:**
- Retrieved only when relevant
- Can handle large document collections
- Dynamically selected based on context

**Example:**
Complete product documentation, comprehensive policy manuals, customer case studies
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Use instructions for "always-on" essential context; use RAG for comprehensive reference material.
</Tip>

## Document Preparation

Prepare documents for optimal RAG effectiveness:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Use Clear Headings">
Well-structured documents with clear section headings improve retrieval accuracy.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keep Sections Focused">
Each section should cover one topic completely.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Consistent Terminology">
Maintain consistent terms throughout to improve semantic matching.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Include Context">
Make sections understandable independently—RAG may retrieve individual sections.

**Good:** "Our Premium tier ($99/month) includes unlimited users, 500GB storage, priority support."

**Avoid:** "It includes unlimited users." (unclear without context)
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Supported Document Formats

**Text-based:**
- PDF, Word (.docx), Plain text (.txt), Markdown (.md), Rich text (.rtf)

**Structured:**
- Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, HTML documents

<Info>
Documents are processed to extract text content. Complex formatting may not be preserved.
</Info>

---

## RAG Performance

**Factors affecting retrieval quality:**
- **Document quality**: Clear, well-structured content retrieves better
- **Query formulation**: Specific queries retrieve more relevant results
- **Chunk size**: Automatically optimized by WonkaChat

**Performance:**
- Retrieval latency: Minimal (<1 second typically)
- Scales to large document collections
- Changes are processed and indexed automatically

---

## RAG Security

**Data handling:**
- Documents stored securely within your WonkaChat environment
- Never used to train AI models
- Subject to your data retention policies
- Accessible only to users with agent permissions

**Access control:**
- RAG respects WonkaChat's permission model
- Retrieved information subject to user permissions
- All document access logged for audit

<Info>
See [Security & Governance](/security-governance/security-overview) for comprehensive details.
</Info>

---

## Monitoring Effectiveness

**Indicators of effective RAG:**
- Agents correctly reference document information
- Accurate policy and procedure citations
- Fewer generic or incorrect answers
- Consistent information across conversations

**Signs needing improvement:**
- Agents fail to find relevant information
- Retrieved information is outdated
- Inconsistent responses to similar questions
