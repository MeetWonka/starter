Agents are located in two places: the creation interface for building and managing agents, and the usage interface for starting conversations with agents.

<Info>
Organization agents are shared by administrators. Personal agents are created by you for your own use.

## Agent Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Organization Agents" icon="building">
Pre-built by administrators, available organization-wide. Standardize common workflows across teams.
</Card>

<Card title="Personal Agents" icon="user">
Created by you for your workflows. Only you can see and use these unless an administrator shares them.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Sharing Personal Agents

To make your personal agent available organization-wide:

1. Create and test your agent
2. Contact your administrator to request sharing
3. Administrator reviews configuration and security
4. Once approved, agent becomes available to designated users or groups

<Warning>
Only administrators can share agents organization-wide. This maintains security and governance standards.
</Warning>

---

## Permissions and Access

- **Standard users**: Create personal agents, use organization agents they have permission to access
- **Administrators**: Create organization agents, control sharing, manage access permissions
- **Tool access**: Agents can only use tools you personally have permission to access

<Info>
For comprehensive access control details, see [Security & Governance](/security-governance/access-control).

## Permission Model

WonkaChat uses role-based access control for agents:

**Standard Users:**
- Create personal agents
- Use organization agents (if granted access)
- Modify own personal agents
- Request administrator promotion to organization-wide

**Administrators:**
- All standard user capabilities
- Create organization-wide agents
- Control agent visibility and permissions
- Assign agents to specific groups
- Configure agent tool access boundaries

---

## Agent Visibility

Administrators configure agent visibility:
- **Public**: Visible to all organization members
- **Group-specific**: Visible only to specific groups
- **Private**: Personal agents (creator only)

---

## Tool Access Inheritance

Agents execute with your user permissions, not elevated privileges.

**Security model:**
1. Agent configured with specific MCP tools
2. When you use the agent, it can only access tools you have permission to use
3. If agent requires a tool you lack access to, operation fails
4. All actions are logged and attributable to you

<Check>
No permission escalation through agentsâ€”users cannot bypass access controls.
</Check>

---

## Audit and Compliance

All agent operations are logged:
- Agent creation and modification
- Agent access and usage
- Tool invocations through agents
- Permission changes
- Agent deletion

See [Security & Governance](/security-governance/security-overview) for comprehensive details.
