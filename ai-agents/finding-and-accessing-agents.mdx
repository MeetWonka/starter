Agents are located in two places: the creation interface for building and managing agents, and the usage interface for starting conversations with agents.

## Locating Agents


### Agent Usage Interface

There are two ways to access and start conversations with agents:

#### 1. Agent Marketplace

Access the agent marketplace from the top left of your screen. The marketplace organizes agents by categories, making it easy to discover and browse available agents. It is especially useful when you have many agents to choose from.

</Frame>

**Features:**
- Browse agents by category
- Search functionality for quick discovery
- View detailed agent descriptions


#### 2. My Agents Quick Access

Access your agents directly from the model selection dropdown at the top of the screen. At the bottom of the dropdown, you'll see "My Agents". You can hover over it to reveal a list of all your available agents with a search field.

</Frame>

**Features:**
- Quick access to your frequently used agents
- Integrated search field for fast agent lookup
- No need to navigate away from your current screen

<Tip>
Use "My Agents" for quick access to agents you use regularly and the marketplace when exploring what agents are available or when you need to discover agents for specific use cases.
</Tip>

### Agent Creation & Management

In your WonkaChat interface, find the **Agent Builder** on the right side of the screen. This panel allows you to create and manage your AI agents.

- Create new agents with custom instructions

- Configure model and parameters
